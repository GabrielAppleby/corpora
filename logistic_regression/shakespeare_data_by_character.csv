0,tim.,TIMON of Athens,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-tim.," Imprison'd is he, say you?

 Noble Ventidius!   Well;
I am not of that feather to shake off
My friend when he must need me. I do know him
A gentleman that well deserves a help:
Which he shall have:  I'll pay the debt, and free him.

 Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
But to support him after. Fare you well.

 Freely, good father.

 I have so: what of him?

 Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!

 Well; what further?

 The man is honest.

 Does she love him?

 Love you the maid?

 How shall she be endow'd,
If she be mated with an equal husband?

 This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
To build his fortune I will strain a little,
For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
And make him weigh with her.

 My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.

 I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
Go not away. What have you there, my friend ?

 Painting is welcome.
The painting is almost the natural man;
For since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
Even such as they give out. I like your work;
And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
Till you hear further from me.

 Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand:
We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
Hath suffer'd under praise.

 A mere satiety of commendations.
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
It would unclew me quite.

 Well mock'd.

 Look, who comes here: will you be chid?
Enter APEMANTUS.
 Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!

 Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.

 Yes.

 Thou art proud, Apemantus.

             What trumpet's that?

 Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.
[Exeunt some Attendants. 
You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest.
Most welcome, sir!

 Right welcome, sir!
Ere we depart, we 'll share a bounteous time
In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.

[Exeunt all except Apemantus.
Enter two Lords.
 O, by no means,
Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:
I gave it freely ever; and there's none
Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.

 Nay, my lords,

[They all stand ceremoniously looking on Timon.
Ceremony was but devised at first
To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
Than my fortunes to me.
[They sit.
 O, Apemantus, you are welcome.

 Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye 've got a humour there
  My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.

    What means that trump?
Enter a Servant.
How now?

 Ladies! what are their wills?

  They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:
Music, make their welcome!
[Exit Cupid.
 You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
Which was not half so beautiful and kind;
You have added worth unto 't and lustre,
And entertain'd me with mine own device;
I am to thank you for 't.

 Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:
Please you to dispose yourselves.

 Flavius.

 The little casket bring me hither.

 O my friends,
I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,
I must entreat you, honour me so much
As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
Kind my lord.

 They are fairly welcome.

 Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:
I prithee, let's be provided to show the entertainment.

 I shall accept them fairly; let the presents
Be worthily entertain'd.
Enter a third Servant.
How now! what news?

 I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
Not without fair reward.

 You do yourselves
Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:
Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.

 And now I remember, my lord, you gave
Good words the other day of a bay courser
I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.

 You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man
Can justly praise but what he does affect:
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;
I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.

 I take all and your several visitations
So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich:
It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living
Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
Lie in a pitch'd field.

 And so
Am I to you.

 All to you. Lights, more lights!

 Ready for his friends.

[Exeunt all but Apemantus and Timon.
 Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen,
I would be good to thee.

  So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,
My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?

 Dues!  Whence are you?

 Go to my steward.

 Mine honest friend,
I prithee, but repair to me next morning.

 Contain thyself, good friend.

 Give me breath.
I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
I'll wait upon you instantly.

[Exeunt Alcibiades and Lords.
 [To Flav.]
Come hither: pray you.
How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd
With clamorous demands of date-broke bonds,
And the detention of long-since-due debts,
Against my honour?

 Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd.
[Exit. 
 You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time
Had you not fully laid my state before me,
That I might so have rated my expense,
As I had leave of means?

 Go to:
Perchance some single vantages you took,
When my indisposition put you back;
And that unaptness made your minister,
Thus to excuse yourself.

 Let all my land be sold.

 To Lacedaemon did my land extend.

 You tell me true.

 Prithee, no more.

 Come, sermon me no further;
No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
Why dost thou weep?   Canst thou the conscience lack,
To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
If I would broach the vessels of my love,
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
As I can bid thee speak.

 And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,
That I account them blessings; for by these
Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.
Within there!   Flaminius! Servilius!
Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other
Servants.
  Go you, sir, to the senators--
Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have
Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant
A thousand talents to me.

 Is 't true? can 't be?

 You gods, reward them!
Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.
[To a Serv.]
Go to Ventidius.
[To Flav.] Prithee, be not sad, 
Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak,
No blame belongs to thee. [To Ser.]
Ventidius lately
Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd
Into a great estate: when he was poor,
Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,
I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;
Bid him suppose some good necessity
Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd
With those five talents [Exit Serv.]
.
[To Flav.] That had, give't these fellows 
To whom 'tis instant due.   Ne'er speak, or think,
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.

 What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
Have I been ever free, and must my house
Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
The place which I have feasted, does it now,
Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?

      They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
Creditors? devils!

   So fitly?   Go, bid all my friends again.
Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:
All, sirrah, all:
I'll once more feast the rascals.

 Be 't not in thy care; go,
I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide
Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
[Exeunt.
         May you a better feast never behold,
You knot of mouth-friends! smoke and lukewarm water
Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces
Your reeking villany.

Throwing the water in their faces.
Live loathed and long,
Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,
You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,
Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minutejacks!
Of man and beast the infinite malady
Crust you quite o'er!   What, dost thou go?
Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--
Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.

[Throws the dishes at them, and drives
                                      them out.
What, all in motion?   Henceforth   be no feast,
Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be
Of Timon man and all humanity!
Exit.
Re-enter the Lords, Senators, &c. 
 Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,
And fence not Athens!   Matrons, turn incontinent!
Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from   the bench,
And minister in their steads! to general filths
Convert o' the instant, green virginity,
Do't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;
Rather than render back, out with your knives,
And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
Thy mistress is o' the brothel!   Son of sixteen,
Pluck the lined crutch from   thy old limping sire,
With it beat out his brains!   Piety, and fear,
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
Decline to your confounding contraries.
And let confusion live!  Plagues, incident to men,
Your potent and infectious fevers heap
On Athens, ripe for stroke!   Thou cold sciatica,
Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
As lamely as their manners!   Lust and liberty
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
That 'gainst the stream   of virtue they may strive,
And drown themselves in riot!   Itches, blains,
Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop
Be general leprosy!   Breath infect breath,
That their society, as their friendship, may
Be merely poison!   Nothing I'll bear from thee,
But nakedness, thou detestable town!
Take thou that too, with multiplying bans
Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--
The Athenians both within and out that wall!
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
To the whole race of mankind, high and low!
Amen.
[Exit.
 O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
Infect the air!   Twinn'd   brothers of one womb,
Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortunes;
But thy contempt of nature.
Raise me this beggar, and deny't that lord;
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
The beggar native honour.
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
In purity of manhood stand upright,
And say 'This man's a flatterer'? if one be,
So are they all; for every grise of fortune
Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:
Destruction fang mankind!   Earth, yield me roots!
[Digging.
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
With thy most operant poison! What is here?
Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold?   No, gods,
I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods?   Why, this
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
Pluck stout men's pillows from   below   their heads:
This yellow slave
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
And give them title, knee and approbation
With senators on the bench: this is it
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds
Among the rout of nations, I will make thee
Do thy right nature. [March afar off.]
Ha! a drum?   Thou'rt quick,
But yet I'll bury thee: thou 'lt go, strong thief,
When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
Nay, stay thou out for earnest.

[Keeping some gold.
Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in
  warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA.
 A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
For showing me again the eyes of man!

 I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
That I might love thee something.

 I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,
I desire not to know. Follow thy drum;
With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:
Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;
Then what should war be?   This fell whore of thine
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
For all her cherubin look.

 I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
To thine own lips again.

 As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
But then renew I could not, like the moon;
There were no suns to borrow of.

 None, but to
Maintain my opinion.

  Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.

 As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.

 Art thou Timandra?

 Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;
Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
To the tub-fast and the diet.

 I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.

 How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
I had rather be alone.

 Keep it, I cannot eat it.

 Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?

 The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!

 That, by killing of villains,
Thou wast born to conquer my country.
Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;
Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
It is her habit only that is honest,
Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,
That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay thy soldiers:
Make large confusion: and thy fury spent,
Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.

 Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse upon thee!

 Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,--
Although, I know, you'll swear, terribly swear
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths.
I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,
No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face:
A pox of wrinkles!

 Consumptions sow
In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
That he may never more false title plead,
Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
That scolds against the quality of flesh,
And not believes himself: down with the nose,
Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
Of him that, his particular to foresee,
Smells from the general weal: make curl'dpate ruffians bald;
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
Derive some pain from you: plague all;
That your activity may defeat and quell
The source of all erection. There's more gold:
Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
And ditches grave you all!

 More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.

 If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.

 Yes, thou spokest well of me.

 Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
Thy beagles with thee.

 That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,
[Digging.
Whose womb unmeasurable, and   infinite breast,
Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,
Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
Whereon Hyperion's quickening   fire doth shine;
Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
Teem   with new monsters, whom thy upward face
Hath to the marbled mansion all above
Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
Whereof ingrateful   man,   with   liquorish draughts
And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
That from it all consideration slips!
Enter APEMANTUS.
More man? plague, plague!

 'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
Whom   I would imitate: consumption catch thee!

 Were I like thee, I 'ld throw away myself.

 A fool of thee: depart.

 I hate thee worse.

 Thou flatter'st misery.

 Why dost thou seek me out?

 Always a villain's office or a fool's.
Dost please thyself in 't?

 What! a knave too?

 Not by his breath that is more miserable.
Thou art a slave, whom fortune's tender arm
With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
Hadst thou, like us from   our first swath, proceeded
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
To such as may the passive drugs of it
Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself
In general riot; melted down thy youth
In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
Who had the world as my confectionary,
The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
At duty, more than I could frame employment,
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
Do on the oak, have with one winter's brush
Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,
That never knew but better, is some burden:
Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given ?
If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
To some she beggar and compounded thee
Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.

 Ay, that I am not thee.

 I, that I am one now:
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
I'd give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
That the whole life of Athens were in this!
Thus would I eat it.
[Eating a root.
 First mend my company, take away thyself.

 'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;
If not, I would it were.

 Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.

 The best and truest;
For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.

 Under that's above me,
Where feedest thou o' days, Apemantus?

            Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!

 All villains that do stand by thee are pure.

 If I name thee.
I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.

 Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
I swound to see thee.

 Away,
Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
A stone by thee.
[Throws a stone at him.
 Slave !

 Rogue, rogue, rogue!
I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
But even the mere necessities upon 't.
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
[To the gold]
O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
That solder'st close impossibilities,
And makest them  kiss! that speak'st with every tongue,
To every purpose!   O thou touch of hearts!
Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
May have the world in empire!

 Throng'd to

 Thy back, I prithee.

 Long live so, and so die.   [Exit Apemantus.
I am quit.
Moe things like men!   Eat, Timon, and abhor them.
Enter Banditti.
   Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
Why should you want?   Behold, the earth hath roots;
Within this mile break   forth a hundred springs;
The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?

 Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
In limited professions.   Rascal thieves,
Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
His antidotes are poison, and he slays
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
Do villany, do, since you protest to do 't,
Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery:
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
Have uncheck'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
Break open shops; nothing can you steal,
But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
I give you; and gold confound you whosoe'er!
Amen.

 Away! what art thou?

 Why dost ask that?   I have forgot all men;
Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.

 Then I know thee not:
I never had honest man about me, I; all
I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.

 What, dost thou weep?   Come nearer. Then I love thee,
Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!

 Had I a steward
So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
Was born of woman.
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
One honest man-mistake me not-but one;
No more, I pray,-and he's a steward.
How fain would I have hated all mankindl
And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
I fell with curses.
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
For, by oppressing and betraying me,
Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
For many so arrive at second masters,
Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--
Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
Expecting in return twenty for one?

 Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
Here, ake: the gods out of my misery
Have sent thee treasure.   Go, live rich and happy;
But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
Debts wither 'em   to nothing; be men like blasted woods,
And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
And so farewell and thrive.

 If thou hatest curses,
Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:
Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.

[Exit Flavius.   Timon retires to his cave.
   I'll meet you at the turn. What a god's gold,
That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
Than where swine feed!
'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
Settlest admired reverence in a slave:
To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey
Fit I meet them.
[Coming forward.
 Have I once lived to see two honest men ?

 Let it go naked, men may see 't the better:
You that are honest, by being what you are,
Make them best seen and known.

 Ay, you are honest men.

 Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.

 Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;
I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.

 Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;
Thou counterfeit'st most lively.

 E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,
Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
That thou art even natural in thine art.
But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,
I must needs say you have a little fault:
Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
You take much pains to mend.

 You'll take it ill.

 Will you, indeed?

 There's never one of you but trusts a knave,
That mightily deceives you.

 Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured
That he's a made-up villain.

 Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
Rid me these villains from your companies:
Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
Confound them by some course, and come to me,
I'll give you gold enough.

 You that way and you this, but two in company;
Each man apart, all single and alone,
Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
If where thou art two villains shall not be,
Come not near him.   If thou wouldst not reside
But where one villain is, then him abandon.
Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:
[To Painter]
You have work'd for me; there 's payment for you: hence!
 [To Poet]
You are an alchemist; make gold of that.
Out, rascal dogs!
Beats them out, and then retires to his cave.
Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators.
 Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and be hang'd:
For each true word, a blister! and each false
Be as a cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,
Consuming it with speaking!

 Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.

 I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
Could I but catch it for them.

 You witch me in it;
Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.

 Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
That Timon cares not.   But if he sack fair Athens,
And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
Giving our holy virgins to the stain
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war
Then let him know, and tell him   Timon speaks it,
In pity of our aged and our youth,
I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
While you have throats to answer: for myself,
There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
But I do prize it at my love before
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
To the protection of the prosperous gods,
As thieves to keepers.

 Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
It will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
Of health and living now begins to mend,
And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
And last so long enough!

 But yet I love my country, and am not
One that rejoices in the common wreck,
As common bruit doth put it.

 Commend me to my loving countrymen,--

 Commend me to them,
And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.

 I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
That mine own use invites me to cut down,
And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,
Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree
From   high   to low   throughout, that whoso please
To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.

 Come not to me again: but say to Athens,
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
Who once a day with his embossed froth
The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
What is amiss plague and infection mend!
Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
Sun, hide thy beams!   Timon hath done his reign.
[Retires to his cave.

2,sem.,SEMPRONIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-sem.," Must he needs trouble me in't,--hum!
--'bove all others?
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
Owe their estates unto him.

 How! have they denied him?
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
And does he send to me?   Three? hum!
It shows but little love or judgement in him:
Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,
Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,
That might have known my place: I see no sense for't.
But his occasions might have woo'd me first;
For, in my conscience, I was the first man
That e'er received gift from him:
And does he think so backwardly of me now,
That I'll requite it last? No:
So it may prove an argument of laughter
To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.
I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
I 'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
And with their faint reply this answer join;
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.

"
3,ven.,VENTIDIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-ven.," Most honour'd Timon,
It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,
And call him to long peace.
He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
To your free heart, I do return those talents,
Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
I derived liberty.

 A noble spirit!

"
4,alcib.,ALCIBIADES,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-alcib.," Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed
Most hungerly on your sight.

   Ay, defiled land, my lord.

 Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!

 I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
For pity is the virtue of the law,
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.
He is a man, setting his fate aside,
Of comely virtues:
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
An honour in him which buys out his fault--
But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
He did oppose his foe:
And with such sober and unnoted passion
He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
As if he had but proved an argument.

 My lord,--

 My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,
If I speak like a captain.
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
And not endure all threats? sleep upon 't,
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
Without repugnancy?   If there be
Such valour in the bearing, what make we
Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
If wisdom be in suffering.   O my lords,
As you are great, be pitifully good:
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
But, in defence. by mercy, 'tis most just.
To be in anger is impiety;
But who is man that is not angry?
Weigh but the crime with this.

 In vain! his service done
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium.
Were a sufficient briber for his life.

 I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
And slain in fight many of our enemies:
How full of valour did he bear himself
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!

 Hard fate! he might have died in war.
My lords, if not for any parts in him--
Though his right arm might purchase his own time
And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,
Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:
And, for I know your reverend ages love
Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
My honours to you, upon his good returns.
If by this crime he owes the law his life,
Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore;
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.

 Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
I do beseech you, know me.

 Call me to your remembrances.

 I cannot think but your age has forgot me;
It could not else be, I should prove so base,
To sue, and be denied such common grace:
My wounds ache at you.

 Banish me!
Banish your dotage; banish usury,
That makes the senate ugly.

 Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live
Only in bone, that none may look on you!
I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,
While they have told their money and let out
Their coin upon large interest, I myself
Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
Pours into captains' wounds?   Banishment!
It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
That I may strike at Athens.   I'll cheer up
My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.

[Exit.
 What art thou there? speak.

 What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,
That art thyself a man?

 I know thee well;
But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.

 How came the noble Timon to this change?

 Noble Timon,
What friendship may I do thee?

 What is it, Timon?

 I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.

 I see them now; then was a blessed time.

 Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits
Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
I have but little gold of late, brave Timon
The want whereof doth daily make revolt
In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,
How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--

 I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.

 Why, fare thee well:
Here is some gold for thee.

 When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--

 Ay, Timon, and have cause.

 Why me, Timon?

 Hast thou gold yet?  I'll take the gold thou givest me,
Not all thy counsel.

 Strike up the drum towards Athens!   Farewell, Timon:
If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.

 I never did thee harm.

 Call'st thou that harm?

 We but offend him. Strike!

[Drum beats.Exeunt Alcibiades,
Phrynia, and Timandra.
 Sound to this coward and lascivious town
Our terrible approach.
[A parley sounded.
Enter Senators on the walls.
Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
With all licentious measure, making your wills
The scope of justice; till now myself and such
As slept within the shadow of your power
Have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
Cries of itself 'No more:' now   breathless wrong
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
And pursy insolence shall break his wind
With fear and horrid flight.

 Then there's my glove;
Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears
With my more noble meaning, not a man
Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
But shall be render'd to your public laws
At heaviest answer.

 Descend, and keep your words.

[The Senators descend, and open the gates.
Enter Soldier.
 'Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left!
Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:
Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait.'
These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our droplets which
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
Is noble Timon: of whose memory
Hereafter more.   Bring me into your city,
And I will use the olive with my sword,
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
Let our drums strike.
[Exeunt.
"
5,apem.,APEMANTUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-apem.," Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.

 Are they not Athenians?

 Then I repent not.

 Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.

                      So, so, there!
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
That there should be small love 'mongst these sweet knaves,
And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
Into baboon and monkey.

        Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?

 No;
You shall not make me welcome:
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.

  I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
Methinks they should invite them without knives;
Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.

 This and my food are equals; there's no odds;
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods,

Apemantus' grace.
Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
I pray for no man but myself:
Grant I may never prove so fond,
To trust man on his oath or bond;
Or a harlot, for her weeping;
Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping;
Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
Amen. So fall to't:
Rich men sin, and I eat root.

[Eats and drinks.
Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!

  Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.

 Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.

 Much!
[Tucket, within.

 Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
They dance! they are mad women.
Like madness is the glory of this life,
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;
And spend our flatteries, to drink those men
Upon whose age we void it up again,
With poisonous spite and envy.
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
Of their friends' gift?
I should fear those that dance before me now
Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.

The Lords rise from table, with much adoring
   of TIMON; and to show their loves, each
   singles out an Amazon, and all dance, men
   with women, a lofty strain or two to the
   hautboys, and cease.
  What a coil's here!
Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
Methinks, false hearts should   never have sound legs.
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.

  So:
Thou wilt not hear me now; thcu shalt not then:
I'll lock thy heaven from thee.
O, that men's ears should be
To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!
[Exit.
                 I was directed hither: men report
Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.

 This is in thee a nature but infected;
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
This slave-like habit? and   these looks of care ?
Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;
Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot
That ever Timon   was. Shame   not these woods,
By putting on the cunning of a carper.
Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
Blow   off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;
Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
Rascals should have't.   Do not assume my likeness.

 Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,
That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
And skip where thou point'st out? will the cold brook,
Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit?   Call the creatures
Whose naked natures live in all the spite
Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
To the conflicting elements exposed,
Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;
O, thou shalt find--

 I love thee better now than e'er I did.

 Why?

 I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.

 To vex thee.

 Ay.

 If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou
Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,
Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
Outlives incertain pomp, is crown'd before:
The one is filling still, never complete;
The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
Worse than the worst, content.
Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.

 Art thou proud yet?

 I, that I was
No prodigal.

 Here; I will mend thy feast.

[Offering him a root.
 So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.

 What wouldst thou have to Athens?

 Here is no use for gold.

 Where liest o' nights, Timon?

            Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.

 A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.

 There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.

 I would my tongue could rot them off!

 Would thou wouldst burst!

 Beast !

 Toad !

 Would 'twere so!
But not till I am dead. I'll say thou 'st gold:
Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.

 Ay.

 Live, and love thy misery.

"
6,flav.,FLAVIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-flav.," My lord?

 Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!
[Aside.]
There is no crossing him in's humour;
Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith, I should,
When all's spent, he'ld be cross'd then, an he could.
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind
That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.

[Exit.
 I beseech your honour,
Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.

 I scarce know how.
Enter a second Servant.
 What will this come to?
He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,
And all out of an empty coffer:
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
To show him what a beggar his heart is,
Being of no power to make his wishes good:
His promises fly so beyond his state
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
For every word; he is so kind that he now
Pays interest for't; his land's put to their books.
Well, would I were gently put out of office
Before I were forced out!
Happier is he that has no friend to feed
Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
I bleed inwardly for my lord.
Exit.
 No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
That he will neither know how to maintain it,
Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account
How things go from him, nor resumes no care
Of what is to continue: never mind
Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.
What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel:
I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.
Fie, fie, fie, fie!
Enter CAPHIS, and the Servants of ISIDORE and VARRO.
 Please you, gentlemen,
The time is unagreeable to this business:
Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
That I may make his lordship understand
Wherefore you are not paid.

 Pray, draw near.
Exit.
Enter APEMANTUS and Fool. 
 Pray you, walk near; I'll speak with you anon.
[Exeunt Servants. 
 You would not hear me,
At many leisures I proposed.

 O my good lord,
At many times I brought in my accounts,
Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
And say, you found them in mine honesty.
When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;
Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
To hold your hand more close: I did endure
Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts.

 'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone;
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
Of present dues: the future comes apace:
What shall defend the interim? and at length
How goes our reckoning?

 O my good lord, the world is but a word:
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
How quickly were it gone!

 If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
Call me before the exactest auditors
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
When all our offices have been oppress'd
With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
And set mine eyes at flow.

 Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon's?
Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!
Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,
These flies are couch'd.

 Assurance bless your thoughts!

 Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!

 I have been bold--
For that I knew it the most general way--
To them to use your signet and your name;
But they do shake their heads, and I am here
No richer in return.

 They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,
That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
Do what they would; are sorry--you are honourable,--
But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--
Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
May catch a wrench--would all were well-'tis pity;--
And so, intending other serious matters,
After distasteful looks end these hard factions,
With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
They froze me into silence.

 I would I could not think it: that thought is bounty's foe;
Being free itself, it thinks all others so.

[Exeunt.
  Ay,
If money were as certain as your waiting,
'Twere sure enough.
Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
And take down the interest into their gluttonous maws.
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
Let me pass quietly:
Believe't, my lord and I have made an end;
I have no more to reckon, he to spend.

 If 'twill not serve, 'tis not so base as you;
For you serve knaves.
[Exit.
    O, my lord,
You only speak from your distracted soul;
There is not so much left, to furnish out
A moderate table.

 Alack, my fellows, what shall I say to you?
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
I am as poor as you.

 All broken implements of a ruin'd house.

 Good fellows all,
The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,
As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;
Nay, put out all your hands.   Not one word more:
Thus we part rich in sorrow, parting poor.

Servants embrace, and part several ways.
O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
Since riches point to misery and contempt?
Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
But in a dream of friendship?
To have his pomp and all what state compounds
But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
Poor honest lord, brought low   by his own heart,
Undone by goodness!  Strange, unusual blood,
When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!
Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?
For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men,
My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to
Supply his life, or that which can command it.
I'll follow and inquire him out:
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;
Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.

[Exit.
 O you gods!
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
Full of decay and failing?   O monument
And wonder or good deeds evilly bestow'd!
What an alteration of honour
Has desperate want made!
What viler thing upon the earth than friends
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
Those that would mischief me than those that do!
Has caught me in his eye: I will present
My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,
Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!

 Have you forgot me, sir?

 An honest poor servant of yours.

 The gods are witness,
Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.

 I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
To entertain me as your steward still.

 No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:
You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,
Care of your food and living; and, believe it,
My most honour'd lord,
For any benefit that points to me,
Either in hope or present, I 'ld exchange
For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
To requite me, by making rich yourself.

 .     .    O, let me stay,
And comfort you, my master.

 It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;
For he is set so only to himself
That nothing but himself which looks like man
Is friendly with him.

 Here is his cave.
Peace and content be here   Lord Timon! Timon!
Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,
By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:
Speak to them, noble Timon.
TIMON comes from his cave.
 Stay not, all's in vain.

 Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.

"
7,poet.,Poet,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-poet.," Good day, sir.

 I have not seen you long: how goes the world?

 Ay, that's well known:
But what particular rarity? what strange,
Which manifold record not matches?   See,
Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
Hath conjured to attend.  I know the merchant.

 'When we for recompense have praised the vile,
It stains the glory in that happy verse
Which aptly sings the good.'

 A thing slipp'd idly from me.
Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
Provokes itself and like the current flies
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?

 Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
Let's see your piece.

 So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.

 Admirable: how this grace
Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
Moves in this lip to the dumbness of the gesture
One might interpret.

 I will say of it,
It tutors nature: artificial strife
Lives in these touches, livelier than life.
Enter certain Senators, and pass over.
 The senators of Athens: happy man!

 You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.
I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
Whom   this beneath world doth embrace and hug
With amplest entertainment: my free drift
Halts not particularly, but moves itself
In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
Infects one comma in the course I hold;
But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
Leaving no tract behind.

 I will unbolt to you.
You see how all conditions, how all minds,
As well of glib and slippery creatures as
Of grave and austere quality, tender down
Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
To Apemantus, that few things loves better
Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
The knee before him and returns in peace
Most rich in Timon's nod.

 Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
That labour on the bosom of this sphere
To propagate their states: amongst them   all,
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,
One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
Whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Translates his rivals.

 Nay, sir, but hear me on.
All those which were his fellows but of late,
Some better than his value, on the moment
Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
Rain sacrificial whispering in his ear,
Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
Drink the free air.

 When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants
Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
Not one accompanying his declining foot.

 Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!

           Nay, let's seek him:
Then do we sin against our own estate,
When we may profit meet, and come too late.

 Hail, worthy Timon!

 Sir,
Having often of your open bounty tasted,
Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,
Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits !
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:
What! to you,
Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
With any size of words.

 Nor I.

"
9,jew.,Jeweller,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-jew.," Nay, that's most fix'd.

 I have a jewel here--

 If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--

 And rich: here is a water, look ye.

 What, my lord! dispraise?

 My lord, 'tis rated
As those which sell would give: but you well know,
Things of like value differing in the owners
Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.

 We'll bear, with your lordship.

 You know me, Apemantus?

"
10,mer.,Merchant,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-mer.," O, 'tis a worthy lord.

 A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
To an untirable and continuate goodness:
He passes.

 O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?

 'Tis a good form.

[Looking at the jewel.
 No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
Which all men speak with him.

 He'll spare none.

  "
11,old-ath.,An old Athenian,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-old-ath.," Lord Timon, hear me speak.

 Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.

 Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.

 This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
By night frequents my house. I am a man
That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
And my estate deserves an heir more raised
Than one which holds a trencher.

 One only daughter have I, no kin else,
On whom I may confer what I have got:
The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
Join with me to forbid him her resort;
Myself have spoke in vain.

 Therefore he will be, Timon:
His honesty rewards him in itself;
It must not bear my daughter.

 She is young and apt:
Our own precedent passions do instruct us
What levity's in youth.

 If in her marriage my consent be missing,
I call the gods to witness, I will choose
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
And dispossess her all.

 Three talents on the present; in future, all.

 Most noble lord,
Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.

"
12,flam.,FLAMINIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-flam.,"      Is't possible the world should so much differ,
And we alive that lived?   Fly, damned baseness,
To him that worships thee!
[Throwing the money back.
 May these add to the number that may scald thee!
Let molten coin be thy damnation,
Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,
It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,
I feel my master's passion! this slave,
Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,
When he is turn'd to poison?
O, may disease only work upon't!
And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
Which my lord paid for, be of any power
To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!

[Exit.
   Servilius, help!   My lord! my lord!
Enter TIMON, in a rage; FLAMINIUS
                    following.
"
13,luc.,LUCILIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-luc.," Here, at your lordship's service.

 Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.

 Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
That state or fortune fall into my keeping,
Which is not owed to you!

Exeunt Lucilius and Old Athenian.
        I know his lordship is but merry with me;
He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.

   True, as you said, Simon is shrunk indeed;
And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
[Exit.
"
14,ser.,SERVILIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-ser.,"    But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
If his occasion were not virtuous,
I should not urge it half so faithfully.

    Good gods!

"
15,caph.,CAPHIS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-caph.," Here, sir; what is your pleasure?

 I go, sir.

 I will, sir.

 Good even, Varro: what,
You come for money?

 It is: and yours too, Isidore?

 Would we were all discharged!

 Here comes the lord.
Enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, and Lords, &c.
 My lord, here is a note of certain dues.

 Of Athens here, my lord.

 Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
To the succession of new days this month:
My master is awaked by great occasion
To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
That with your other noble parts you'll suit
In giving him his right.

 Nay, good my lord,--

 If you did know, my lord, my master's wants--

  "
16,phi.,PHILOTUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-phi.," Good day at once.

 Labouring for nine.

 Is not my lord seen yet?

 I wonder on 't; he was wont to shine at seven.

 I am of your fear for that.

 "
17,tit.,TITUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-tit.," The like to you, kind Varro.

 So is theirs and ours.
Enter PHILOTUS.
 I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
Your lord sends now for money.

 And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
For which I wait for money.

 One of Lord Timon's men.

   We wait for certain money here, sir.

  We cannot take this for answer, sir.

  "
18,luc.-serv.,LUCIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-luc.-serv.," Ay, and I think
One business does command us all; for mine
Is money.

              And Sir Philotus too!

                Welcome, good brother.
What do you think the hour?

 So much?

                              Not yet.

 Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:
You must consider that a prodigal course
Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
That is, one may reach deep enough, and yet
Find little.

       Mark, how strange it shows,
Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,
And send for money for 'em.

 Five thousand mine.

  Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?
He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.

 Ay, but this answer will not serve.

 Many do keep their chambers are not sick:
And, if it be so far beyond his health,
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
And make a clear way to the gods.

    "
19,hor.,HORTENSIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-hor.," Lucius!
What, do we meet together?

 Most true, he does.

 It is against my heart.

 I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.

22,first-stran.,First Stranger,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-first-stran.,"  Do you observe this, Hostilius?

 Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the same piece
Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
And kept his credit with his purse,
Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,
But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
He does deny him, in respect of his,
What charitable men afford to beggars.

 For mine own part,
I never tasted Timon in my life,
Nor came any of his bounties over me,
To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
And honourable carriage,
Had his necessity made use of me,
I would have put my wealth into donation,
And the best half should have return'd to him,
So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
For policy sits above conscience.

They only now come but to feast thine eyes.

"
28,first-lord.,First Lord,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-first-lord.,"    He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
The very heart of kindness.

 The noblest mind he carries
That ever govern'd man.

 I'll keep you company.

[Exeunt.
 My lord, we always have confess'd it.

  You see, my lord, how ample you 're beloved.

Music.
Re-enter CUPID, with a mask of
   Ladies as Amazons, with lutes in their
   hands, dancing and playing.
 Where be our men?

 I am so far already in your gifts,--

 We are so virtuously bound--

 The best of happiness,
Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!

29,sec.-lord.,Second Lord,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-sec.-lord.,"     He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
All use of quittance.

 Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?

 Let it flow this way, my good lord.

 Joy had the like conception in our eyes
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.

 Our horses! Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket.
 With more than common thanks I will receive it.

 My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate
Newly alighted, and come to visit you.

    My lord,
They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
They have all denied him.

 Of such nature is his politic love.
This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,
Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,
Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
Many a bounteous year, must be employ'd
Now to guard sure their master.
And this is all a liberal course allows;
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.

Out of his free love, hath presented to you
Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.

 As we do turn our backs
From our companion thrown into his grave,
So his familiars to his buried fortunes
Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,
Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,
A dedicated beggar to the air,
With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,
Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.
Enter other Servants.

Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
Into this sea of air.

And past.

 Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?

Else, surely, his had equall'd.

And I am sent expressly to your lordship.

  "
50,sen.,Senator,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-sen.," And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore
He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,
Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
Of raging waste?   It cannot hold; it will not.
If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,
And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more
Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,
And able horses. No porter at his gate,
But rather one that smiles and still invites
All that pass by. It cannot hold; no reason
Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
Caphis, I say!
Enter CAPHIS.
 Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;
Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased
With slight denial, nor then silenced when--
'Commend me to your master'--and the cap
Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,
My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
Out of mine own; his days and times are past
And my reliances on his fracted dates
Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,
But must not break my back to heal his finger;
Immediate are my needs, and my relief
Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
But find supply immediate. Get you gone:
Put on a most importunate aspect,
A visage of demand! for, I do fear,
When every feather sucks in his own wing,
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.

 'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,
And have the dates in compt.

 Go.
[Exeunt.
"
51,first-sen.,First Senator,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-first-sen.," My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's
Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.

 Now, captain?

 You undergo too strict a paradox,
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
To bring manslaughter into   form   and   set quarrelling
Upon the head of valour; which indeed
Is valour misbegot and came into the world
When sects and factions were newly born:
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
To bring it into danger.
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!

 You cannot make gross sins look clear:
To revenge is no valour, but to bear.

 What's that?

 He dies.

 We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,
On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,
He forfeits his own blood that spills another.

 Do you dare our anger?
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;
We banish thee for ever.

 If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,
Attend our weighing judgement. And, not to swell our spirit,
He shall be executed presently.

[Exeunt Senators.
 Bring us to his cave:
It is our part and promise to the Athenians
To speak with Timon.

 Worthy Timon,--

 The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.

 O, forget
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
The senators with one consent of love
Entreat thee back   to Athens; who   have thought
On special dignities, which vacant lie
For thy best use and wearing.

 Therefore, so please thee to return with us
And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
His country's peace.

 Therefore, Timon,--

 We speak in vain.

 That's well spoke.

 These words become your lips as they pass thorough them.

 I like this well; he will return again.

 His discontents are unremoveably
Coupled to nature.

 It requires swift foot.
[Exeunt.
 Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
As full as thy report?

 Here come our brothers.
Enter the Senators from TIMON.
 Noble and young,
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
Above their quantity.

 These walls of ours
Were not erected by their hands from whom
You have received your griefs; nor are they such
That these great towers, trophies and schools should fall
For private faults in them.

 All have not offended;
For those that were, it is not square to take
On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,
But kill not all together.

 Set but thy foot
Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
To say thou 'lt enter friendly.

"
52,sec.-sen.,Second Senator,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-sec.-sen.," Most true; the law shall bruise him.
Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants. 
 You breathe in vain.

 He has made too much plenty with 'em;
He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:
If there were no foes, that were enough
To overcome him: in that beastly fury
He has been known to commit outrages,
And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

 How!

 At all times alike
Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,
Offering the fortunes of his former days,
The former man may make him. Bring us to him,
And chance it as it may.

 They confess
Toward the forgetfulness too general, gross:
Which now the public body, which doth seldom
Play the recanter, feeling in itself
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
Of it own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,
Together with a recompense more fruitful
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
And write in thee the figures of their love,
Ever to read them thine.

 And shakes his threatening sword
Against the walls of Athens.

 And enter in our ears like great triumphers
In their applauding gates.

 Our hope in him is dead: let us return,
And strain what other means is left unto us
In our dear peril.

 We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.

 So did we woo
Transformed Timon to our city's love
By humble message and by promised means:
We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
The common stroke of war.

 Nor are they living
Who were the motives that you first went out;
Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess
Hath broke their hearts.   March, noble lord,
Into our city with thy banners spread:
By decimation, and a tithed death--
If thy revenges hunger for that food
Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,
And by the hazard of the spotted die
Let die the spotted.

 What thou wilt,
Thou rather shalt enforce with thy smile
Than hew to 't with thy sword.

 Throw thy glove,
Or any token of thine honour else,
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
And not as our confusion, all thy powers
Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
Have seal'd thy full desire.

"
53,third-sen.,Third Senator,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-third-sen.," What!

 No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
The enemies' drum   is heard, and   fearful scouring
Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:
Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.

[Exeunt.
"
54,mess.,Messenger,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-mess.," Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
His means most short, his creditors most strait:
Your honourable letter he desires
To those have shut him up; which failing,
Periods his comfort.

 Your lordship ever binds him.

 All happiness to your honour!

[Exit.
Enter an old Athenian.
 'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
All of companionship.

 I have spoke the least:
Besides, his expedition promises
Present approach.

 I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;
Whom, though in general part we were opposed,
Yet our old love made a particular force,
And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
From   Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
With letters of entreaty, which imported
His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
In part for his sake moved.

Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
Our captain hath in every figure skill,
An aged interpreter, though young in days:
Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.

[Exit.
 My noble general, Timon is dead;
Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;
And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
Interprets for my poor ignorance.

"
59,tgv-10,DUKE OF MILAN,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-10," Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
What say you to a letter from your friends
Of much good news?

 Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman ?

 Hath he not a son?

 You know him well?

 Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
He is as worthy for an empress' love
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
With commendation from great potentates;
And here he means to spend his time awhile:
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.

 Welcome him then according to his worth.
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it;
I will send him hither to you presently.  [Exit.
 Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
We have some secrets to confer about.
                                   [Exit Thu.
Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?

 Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
Which to requite, command me while I live.
This love of theirs myself have often seen,
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Sir Valentine her company and my court:
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
And so unworthily disgrace the man,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
And, that thou mayest perceive my fear of this,
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
The key whereof myself have ever kept;
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.

 Upon mine honour, he shall never know
That I had any light from thee of this.

 Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?

 Be they of much import?

 Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
I am to break with thee of some affairs
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.

 No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
Neither regarding that she is my child
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
I now am full resolved to take a wife
And turn her out to who will take her in:
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
For me and my possessions she esteems not.

 There is a lady in Verona here
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
For long agone I have forgot to court;
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
How and which way I may bestow myself
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.

 But she did scorn a present that I sent her.

 But she I mean is promised by her friends
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
And kept severely from resort of men,
That no man hath access by day to her.

 Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
That no man hath recourse to her by night.

 Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Without apparent hazard of his life.

 Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.

 This very night; for Love is like a child,
That longs for everything that he can come by.

 But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?

 A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?

 Then let me see thy cloak:
I'll get me one of such another length.

 How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
What letter is this same?   What's here? 'To Silvia'!
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
         [Reads.
'My thoughts do harbor with my Silvia nightly.
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
O, could their master come and go as lightly,
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them;
While I, their king, that hither them importune,
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
What's here?
'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
Why, Phaethon,--for thou art Merops' son,--
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
Is privilege for thy departure hence:
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
  [Exit.
 Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.

 This weak impress of love is as a figure
Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
Enter PROTEUS.
How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
According to our proclamation gone?

 My daughter takes his going grievously.

 So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
Makes me the better to confer with thee.

 Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.

 And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
How she opposes her against my will.

 Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
What might we do to make the girl forget
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?

 Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.

 Then you must undertake to slander him.

 Where your good word cannot advantage him,
Your slander cannot endamage him;
Therefore the office is indifferent,
Being entreated to it by your friend.

 And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
Because we know, on Valentine's report,
You are already Love's firm votary
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
Upon this warrant shall you have access
Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
Where you may temper her by your persuasion
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.

 Ay,
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.

 This discipline shows thou hast been in love.

 About it, gentlemen!

 Even now about it! I will pardon you.     [Exeunt.
 How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?

 Saw you my daughter?

 Why then,
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
And Eglamour is in her company.
'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled:
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
                                             [Exit.
 Sir Valentine!

 The more degenerate and base art thou,
To make such means for her as thou hast done
And leave her on such slight conditions.
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
Plead a new state in thy unrival'd merit,
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.

 I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.

 Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee;
Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
Come, let us go: we will include all jars
With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.

 I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.

 What mean you by that saying?

"
60,tgv-4,VALENTINE,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-4," Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Were't not affection chains thy tender days
To the sweet glances of thy honor'd love,
I rather would entreat thy company
To see the wonders of the world abroad,
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
Even as I would when I to love begin.

 And on a love-book pray for my success?

 That's on some shallow story of deep love:
How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.

 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.

 No, I will not, for it boots thee not.

 To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
If lost, why then a grievous labor won;
However, but a folly bought with wit,
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.

 So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.

 Love is your master, for he masters you:
And he that is so yoked by a fool,
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.

 And writers say, as the most forward bud
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
Even so by love the young and tender wit
Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
Losing his verdure even in the prime
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
That art a votary to fond desire?
Once more adieu! my father at the road
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.

 Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Of thy success in love, and what news else
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
And I likewise will visit thee with mine.

 As much to you at home! and so,farewell.    [Exit. 
 Not mine; my gloves are on.

 Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's
mine:
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
Ah, Silvia, Silvia!

                  Why?

   In conclusion, I stand affected to
her.

   No, boy, but as well as I can do them.
Peace! here she comes.
    Madam and mistress, a thousand
good-morrows.
    As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
But for my duty to your ladyship.

 Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
For being ignorant to whom it goes
I writ at random, very doubtfully.

 No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,
Please you command, a thousand times as much;
And yet--

 What means your ladyship? do you not like it?

 Madam, they are for you.

 Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.

 If it please me, madam, what then?

                           My lord, I will be thankful
To any happy messenger from thence.

 Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
To be of worth and worthy estimation
And not without desert so well reputed.

 Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
The honor and regard of such a father.

 I know him as myself; for from our infancy
We have conversed and spent our hours together;
And though myself have been an idle truant,
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
Made use and fair advantage of his days;
His years but young, but his experience old;
His head unmellow'd, but his judgement ripe;
And, in a word, for far behind his worth
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
He is complete in feature and in mind
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.

 Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.

 This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
Had come along with me, but that his mistress
Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.

 Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.

 Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.

 To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
Upon a homely object Love can wink.

 Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,
Confirm his welcome with some special favor.

 Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.

 Leave off discourse of disability:
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.

 Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?

 And how do yours?

 How does your lady? and how thrives your love?

 Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
I have done penance for contemning Love,
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
For in revenge of my contempt of love,
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord
And hath so humbled me as I confess
This is no woe to his correction
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
Now no discourse, except it be of love;
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
Upon the very naked name of love.

 Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?

 Call her divine.

 O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.

 Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
Yet let her be a principality,
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.

 Sweet, except not any;
Except thou wilt except against my love.

 And I will help thee to prefer her too:
She shall be dignified with this high honor--
To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
And, of so great a favor growing proud,
Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
And make rough winter everlastingly.

 Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
She is alone.

 Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
And I as rich in having such a jewel
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
My foolish rival, that her father likes
Only for his possessions are so huge,
Is gone with her along, and I must after,
For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.

 Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our marriage-hour,
With all the cunning manner of our flight,
Determined of; how I must climb her window,
The ladder made of cords, and all the means
Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.

 Will you make haste?

 Please it your grace, there is a messenger
That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
And I am going to deliver them.

 The tenor of them doth but signify
My health and happy being at your court.

 I know it well, my lord; and, sure, the match
Were rich and honorable; besides, the gentleman
Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
Cannot your grace win her to fancy him?

 What would your grace have me to do in this?

 Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
More than quick words do move a woman's mind.

 A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
Send her another; never give her o'er;
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
But rather to beget more love in you:
If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.

 Why, then, I would resort to her by night.

 What lets but one may enter at her window?

 Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
So bold Leander would adventure it.

 When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.

 By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.

 It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
Under a cloak that is of any length.

 Ay, my good lord.

 Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.

 And why not death rather than living torment?
To die is to be banish'd from myself;
And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
What joy is joy if Silvia be not by?
Unless it be to think that she is by
And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
Except I be by Silvia in the night,
There is no music in the nightingale;
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
There is no day for me to look upon;
She is my essence, and I leave to be,
If I be not by her fair influence
Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.
Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE.
    My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,
So much of bad already hath possess'd them.

  No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
Hath she forsworn me?

 No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
What is your news?

 O, I have fed upon this woe already,a
And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?

 No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
Have some malignant power upon my life:
If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,
As ending anthem of my endless dolour.

 I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy
Bid him make haste and meet me at the Northgate.

 O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
[Exeunt Val. and Pro.
 My friends,--

 Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
My riches are these poor habiliments,
Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
You take the sum and substance that I have.

   Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.

  For that which now torments me to rehearse:
I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
Without false vantage or base treachery.

 I was, and held me glad of such a doom.

 My youthful travel therein made me happy,
Or else I often had been miserable.

   I take your offer and will live with you,
Provided that you do no outrages
On silly women or poor passengers.

 How use doth breed a habit in a man!
This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
And to the nightingale's complaining notes
Tune my distresses and record my woes.
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
And leave no memory of what it was!
Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
They love me well; yet I have much to do
To keep them from uncivil outrages.
Withdraw thee, Valentine; who's this comes here?
Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA.
 How like a dream is this I see and hear!
Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.

 Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
Thou friend of an ill fashion!

 Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!

 Then I am paid;
And once again I do receive thee honest.
Who by repentance is not satisfied
Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
And, that my love may appear plain and free,
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.

  Come, come, a hand from either:
Let me be blest to make this happy close;
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.

 Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.
Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
Banished Valentine.

 Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
Come not within the measure of my wrath;
Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands:
Take but possession of her with a touch:
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.

 I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.

 These banish'd men that I have kept withal
Are men endued with worthy qualities:
Forgive them what they have committed here
And let them be recall'd from their exile:
They are reformed, civil, full of good
And fit for great employment, worthy lord.

 And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
What think you of this page, my lord?

 I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.

 Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
The story of your loves discovered:
That done, our day of marriage shall be yours:
One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.

[Exeunt.
"
61,tgv-2,PROTEUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-2," Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
If ever danger do environ thee,
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.

 Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.

 That's a deep story of a deeper love:
For he was more than over shoes in love.

 Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.

 What?

 So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.

 'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.

 Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
The eating canker dwells, so eating love
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.

 And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.

 All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!

 He after honor hunts, I after love:
He leaves his friends to dignify them more;
I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
Enter SPEED.
 But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.

 Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
An if the shepherd be a while away.

                 What said she?

   Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
Being destined to a drier death on shore.
                       [Exit Speed.
I must go send some better messenger:
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
Receiving them from such a worthless post. [Exit.
 Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
Here is her oath for love, her honor's pawn.
O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
To seal our happiness with their consents!
O heavenly Julia!

 May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
Of commendations sent from Valentine,
Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.

 There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
How happily he lives, how well beloved
And daily graced by the emperor;
Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.

 As one relying on your lordship's will
And not depending on his friendly wish.

 My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
Please you, deliberate a day or two.

 Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
And with the vantage of mine own excuse
Hath he excepted most against my love.
O, how this spring of love resembleth
The uncertain glory of an April day,
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
And by and by a cloud takes all away!
Re-enter PANTHINO.
 Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'
Exeunt.
 Have patience, gentle Julia.

 When possibly I can, I will return.

 Why, then, we'll make exchange;
here, take you this.

 Here is my hand for my true constancy;
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness
My father stays my coming; answer not;
The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
That tide will stay me longer than I should.
Julia, farewell!      [Exit Julia.
What, gone without a word?
Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
For truth hath better deeds than words to
grace it.
Enter PANTHINO.
 Go; I come, I come.
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
                                        [Exeunt.
 Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.

 My duty will I boast of; nothing else.

 I'll die on him that says so but yourself.

 That you are worthless.
Re-enter THURIO.
 We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
[Exeunt Silvia and Thurio.
 Your friends are well and have them much commended.

 I left them all in health.

 My tales of love were wont to weary you;
I know you joy not in a love-discourse.

 Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
Was this the idol that you worship so?

 No; but she is an earthly paragon.

 I will not flatter her.

 When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
And I must minister the like to you.

 Except my mistress.

 Have I not reason to prefer mine own?

 Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?

 Then let her alone.

 But she loves you?

 Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
I must unto the road, to disembark
Some necessaries that I needs must use,
And then I'll presently attend you.

 I will. [Exit Valentine.
Even as one heat another heat expels,
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
So the remembrance of my former love
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
Which, like a waxen image 'gainst a fire,
Bears no impression of the thing it was.
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
And that I love him not as I was wont.
O, but I love his lady too too much,
And that's the reason I love him so little.
How shall I dote on her with more advice,
That thus without advice begin to love her!
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
But when I look on her perfections,
There is no reason but I shall be blind.
If I can check my erring love, I will:
If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.  [Exit.
 To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
And even that power which gave me first my oath
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinn'd,
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
At first I did adore a twinkling star,
But now I worship a celestial sun.
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue!  to call her bad,
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
But there I leave to love where I should love.
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
I to myself am dearer than a friend,
For love is still most precious in itself;
And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
I will forget that Julia is alive,
Remembering that my love to her is dead;
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
I cannot now prove constant to myself,
Without some treachery used to Valentine.
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
Myself in counsel, his competitor.
Now presently I'll give her father notice
Of their disguising and pretended flight;
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!
                                             [Exit.
 My gracious lord, that which would discover
The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
But when I call to mind your gracious favours
Done to me, undeserving as I am,
My duty pricks me on to utter that
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
This night intends to steal away your daughter:
Myself am one made privy to the plot.
I know you have determined to bestow her
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
It would be much vexation to your age.
Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
To cross my friend in his intended drift
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.

 Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
How he her chamber-window will ascend
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
For which the youthful lover now is gone
And this way comes he with it presently;
Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
But, good my lord, do it so cunningly
That my discovery be not aimed at;
For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
Hath made me publisher of this pretence.

 Adieu, my lord; Sir Valentine is coming.        [Exit. 
Enter VALENTINE.
        Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.

 Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.

   That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--
From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.

 Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--
Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:
Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
With them, upon her knees, her humble self;
Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die,
Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
That to close prison he commanded her,
With many bitter threats of biding there.

 Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
And study help for that which thou lament'st.
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
And manage it against despairing thoughts.
Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;
Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
The time now serves not to expostulate:
Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;
And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
Of all that may concern thy love-afairs.
As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,
Regard thy danger, and along with me!

 Go, sirrah, find him out.   Come, Valentine.

 Gone, my good lord.

 A little time, my lord, we will kill that grief.

 Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
Let me not live to look upon your grace.

 I do, my lord.

 She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.

 The best way is to slander Valentine
With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
Three things that women highly hold in hate.

 Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.

 And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
Especially against his very friend.

 You have prevail'd, my lord: if I can do it
By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,
She shall not long continue love to him.
But say this weed her love from Valentine,
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.

 As much as I can do, I will effect:
But, you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
You must lay lime to tangle her desires
By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows,

 Say that upon the altar of her beauty
You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
That may discover such integrity:
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
After your dire-lamenting elegies,
Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
With some sweet concert; to their instruments
Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.

 We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
And afterward determine our proceedings.

 Already have I been false to Valentine
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
Under the colour of commending him,
I have access my own love to prefer:
But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
When I protest true loyalty to her,
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
When to her beauty I commend my vows,
She bids me think how I have been forsworn
In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
And give some evening music to her ear.
Enter THURIO and Musicians.
 Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love
Will creep in service where it cannot go.

 Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.

 Ay, Silvia; for your sake.

 Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.

 At Saint Gregory's well.

 Madam, good even to your ladyship.

 One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.

 Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.

 That I may compass yours.

 I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
But she is dead.
    I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.

 Sweet lady, let me rake it from the  earth.

 Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep;
For since the substance of your perfect self
Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
And to your shadow will I make true love.
   As wretches have overnight
That wait for execution in the morn.
[Exeunt Pro. and Sil. severally.
 Sebastian is thy name?   I like thee well
And will employ thee in some service presently.

 I hope thou wilt. [To Launce] How now, you whoreson peasant!
Where have you been these two days loitering?

 And what says she to my little jewel?

 But she received my dog?

 What, didst thou offer her this from me?

 Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
Or ne'er return again into my sight.
Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?
                                    [Exit Launce.
A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
Partly that I have need of such a youth
That can with some discretion do my business,
For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour,
Which, if my augury deceive me not,
Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:
Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
Go presently and take this ring with thee,
Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
She loved me well deliver'd it to me.

 Not so; I think she lives.

 Why dost thou cry 'alas'?

 Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?

 Well, give her that ring and therewithal
This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.
                                             [Exit.
 O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

 No; that it is too little.

 She says it is a fair one.

 But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.

 Ill, when you talk of war.

 O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.

 That you are well derived.

 O, ay; and pities them.

 That they are out by lease.

 Nor I.

 Neither.

 And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
[Exit.
 Madam, this service I have done for you,
Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
To hazard life and rescue you from him
That would have forced your honor and your love;
Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.

 Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
But by my coming I have made you happy.

 What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
Would I not undergo for one calm look!
O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
When women cannot love where they're beloved!

 In love
Who respects friend?

 Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
Can no way change you to a milder form,
I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.

 I'll force thee yield to my desire.

 Valentine!

 My shame and guilt confounds me.
Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
I tender't here; I do as truly suffer.
As e'er I did commit.

  Where is that ring, boy?

 How! let me see:
Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.

 But how camest thou by this ring?
At my depart
I gave this unto Julia.

 How! Julia!

 Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven! were man
But constant, he were perfect. That one error
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?

 Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.

"
62,tgv-1,ANTONIO,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-1," Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?

 Why, what of him?

 Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
Whereon this month I have been hammering.
I have consider'd well his loss of time
And how he cannot be a perfect man,
Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
Experience is by industry achieved
And perfected by the swift course of time.
Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?

 I know it well.

 I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it
The execution of it shall make known.
Even with the speediest expedition
I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.

 Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
And, in good time now will we break with him.
Enter PROTEUS.
 How now! what letter are you reading there?

 Lend me the letter; let me see what news.

 And how stand you affected to his wish?

 My will is something sorted with his wish.
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
For what I will, I will, and there an end.
I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
What maintenance he from his friends receives,
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
To-morrow be in readiness to go:
Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.

 Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
To hasten on his expedition.
             Exeunt Ant. and Pan.
"
63,tgv-11,THURIO,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-11,"           They say that Love hath not an eye at all.

 Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.

 Since his exile she hath despised me most,
Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
That I am desperate of obtaining her.

 Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
You must provide to bottom it on me;
Which must be done by praising me as much
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.

 And thy advice this night I'll put in practice.
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
Let us into the city presently
To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
To give the onset to thy good advice.

 How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?

 Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.

 Who? Silvia?

 I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
Enter, at a distance, HOST, and JULIA in boy's clothes. 
 Where meet we?

 Farewell.
[Exeunt Thu. and Musicians.
Enter SILVIA above.
 Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?

 What, that my leg is too long?

 I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.
    What says she to my face?

 Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.

 How likes she my discourse?

 But well, when I discourse of love and peace?
   What says she to my valor?

 What says she to my birth?

 Considers she my possessions?

 Wherefore?

 Not I.

 Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
That flies her fortune when it follows her.
I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
[Exit.
 Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.

 Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I:
I hold him but a fool that will endanger
His body for a girl that loves him not:
I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.

"
64,tgv-15,EGLAMOUR,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-15," This is the hour that Madam Silvia
Entreated me to call and know her mind:
There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
Madam, madam!
Enter SILVIA above.
 Your servant and your friend;
One that attends your ladyship's command.

 As many, worthy lady, to yourself:
According to your ladyship's impose,
I am thus early come to know what service
It is your pleasure to command me in.

 Madam, I pity much your grievances;
Which since I know they virtuously are placed,
I give consent to go along with you,
Recking as little what betideth me
As much I wish all good befortune you.
When will you go?

 Where shall I meet you?

  The sun begins to gild the western sky;
And now it is about the very hour
That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours.
Unless it be to come before their time;
So much they spur their expedition.
See where she comes.
Enter SILVIA.
Lady, a happy evening!

 Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
If we recover that, we are sure enough.
                                  Exeunt.

SONG.
Who is Silvia? what is she,
n=40> That all our swains commend her?

Holy, fair and wise is she;
 The heaven such grace did lend her,
That she might admired be.
Is she kind as she is fair?
 For beauty lives with kindness.
Love doth to her eyes repair,
 To help him of his blindness,
And, being help'd, inhabits there.
Then to Silvia let us sing,
 That Silvia is excelling;
She excels each mortal thing
 Upon the dull earth dwelling:
To her let us garlands bring.

 If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED.
 Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:
If not, we'll make you sit and rifle you.

 That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.

 Peace! we'll hear him.

 Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.

   Have you long sojourned there?

 What, were you banish'd thence?

  Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?

 Have you the tongues?

 By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar.
This fellow were a king for our wild faction!

  Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?

 Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
Thrust from the company of awful men:
Myself was from Verona banished
For practising to steal away a lady,
An heir, and near allied unto the duke.

 And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.

 And I for such like petty crimes as these.
But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
That they may hold excused our lawless lives;
And partly, seeing you are beautified
With goodly shape and by your own report
A linguist and a man of such perfection
As we do in our quality much want--

 Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
Are you content to be our general?
To make a virtue of necessity
And live, as we do, in this wilderness?

 What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
Say ay, and be captain of us all:
We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
Love thee as our commander and our king.

 But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.

 Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.

 No, we detest such vile base practices.
Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
And show thee all the treasure we have got;
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.
                                     [Exeunt.
 Come, come,
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.

 Come, bring her away.

 Where is the gentleman that was with her?

 Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.

 Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
Fear not; he bears an honorable mind,
And will not use a woman lawlessly.

67,tgv-3,SPEED,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-3," Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?

 Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.

          From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over.
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
your lover.

           Sir, your glove.

 Why, then, this may be yours, for
this is but one.

                  If you love her, you cannot see
her.

    I would you were set, so your affection
would cease.

   O excellent motion! O exceeding
puppet!   Now will he interpret to her.
Enter SILVIA.
   And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'

 O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!
My master sues to her, and she hath taught her suitor,
He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
That my master, being scribe, to himself
should write the letter?

         For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
Or fearing else some messenger that might  her mind discover,
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.

                                                      Sir, we are undone; these are the villains

69,tgv-7,PANTHINO,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-7," 'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.

 He wonder'd that your lordship
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
While other men, of slender reputation,
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
Some of the wars, to try their fortune there;
Some to discover islands far away;
Some to the studious universities.
For any or for all these exercises
He said that Proteus your son was meet,
And did request me to importune you
To let him spend his time no more at home,
Which would be great impeachment to his age,
In having known no travel in his youth.

 I think your lordship is not ignorant
How his companion, youthful Valentine,
Attends the emperor in his royal court.

 'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,
And be in eye of every exercise
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.

 To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
With other gentlemen of good esteem
Are journeying to salute the emperor
And to commend their service to his will.

70,tgv-5,JULIA,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-5," But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?

 Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
That every day with parle encounter me,
In thy opinion which is worthiest love?

 What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?

 What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?

 What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?

 How now! what means this passion
at his name?

 Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?

 Your reason?

 And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?

 Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.

 His little speaking shows his love but small.

 They do not love that do not show their love.

 I would I knew his mind.

 'To Julia.' Say, from whom?

 Say, say, who gave it thee?

 Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines?
To whisper and conspire against my youth?
Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
And you an officer fit for the place.
There, take the paper: see it be return'd;
Or else return no more into my sight.

 Will ye be gone?

 And yet I would I had overlooked the letter:
It were a shame to call her back again
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
And would not force the letter to my view!
Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
When willingly I would have had her here!
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
My penance is to call Lucetta back
And ask remission for my folly past.
What ho! Lucetta!
Re-enter LUCETTA.
 Is't near dinner-time?

 What is't that you took up so gingerly?

 Why didst thou stoop, then?

 And is that paper nothing?

 Then let it lie for those that it concerns.

 Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.

 As little by such toys as may be possible.
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'

 Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?

 And why not you?

 Let's see your song. How now, minion!

 You do not?

 You, minion, are too saucy.

 The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.

 This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
Here is a coil with protestation!
                   [Tears the letter.
Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
You would be fingering them, to anger me.

 Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
Till I have found each letter in the letter,
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
And throw it thence into the raging sea!
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
And yet I will not, sith so prettily
He couples it to his complaining names.
Thus will I fold them one upon another:
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.

Re-enter LUCETTA.
 Well, let us go.

 If you respect them, best to take them up.

 I see you have a month's mind to them.

 Come, come; will't please you go?
                   [Exeunt. I must, where is no remedy.

 If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
                                  [Giving a ring.
 And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.

 Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
Are visibly character'd and engraved,
To lesson me and tell me some good mean
How, with my honour, I may undertake
A journey to my loving Proteus.

 A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
And when the flight is made to one so dear,
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.

 O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
By longing for that food so long a time.
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.

 The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
The current that with gentle murmur glides,
Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
But when his fair course is not hindered,
He makes sweet music with the enamell'd stones,
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
And so by many winding nooks he strays
With willing sport to the wild ocean.
Then let me go and hinder not my course:
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
And make a pastime of each weary step,
Till the last step have brought me to my love;
And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.

 Not like a woman; for I would prevent
The loose encounters of lascivious men:
Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
As may beseem some well-reputed page.

 No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
To be fantastic may become a youth
Of greater time than I shall show to be.

 That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.

 Out, out, Lucetta! that will be ill-favor'd.

 Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
I fear me, it will make me scandalized.

 Nay, that I will not.

 That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
And instances of infinite of love
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.

 Base men, that use them to so base effect!
But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth;
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.

 Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
Only deserve my love by loving him;
And presently go with me to my chamber,
To take a note of what I stand in need of,
To furnish me upon my longing journey.
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
My goods, my lands, my reputation;
Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
Come, answer not, but to it presently!
I am impatient of my tarriance.
[Exeunt. 
           I would always have one play but one thing.
But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?

  Peace! stand aside: the company parts.

 'Twere false, if I should speak it;
For I am sure she is not buried.

 He heard not that.

 If 'twere a substance, you would, sure, deceive it,
And make it but a shadow, as I am.

   Not so; but it hath been the longest night
That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.
[Exeunt.
 In what you please: I'll do what I can.

 It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
She is dead, belike?

 Alas!

 I cannot choose
But pity her.

 Because methinks that she loved you as well
As you do love your lady Silvia:
She dreams on him that has forgot her love;
You dote on her that cares not for your love.
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
And thinking on it makes me cry 'alas!'

 How many women would do such a message?
Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
That with his very heart despiseth me?
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
Because I love him, I must pity him.
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
To bind him to remember my good will;
And now am I, unhappy messenger,
To plead for that which I would not obtain,
To carry that which I would have refused,
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
I am my master's true-confirmed love;
But cannot be true servant to my master,
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
Enter SILVIA, attended.
Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.

 If you be she, I do entreat your patience
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.

 From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.

 Ay, madam.

 Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
This is the letter to your ladyship.

 It may not be; good madam, pardon me.

 Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.

 She thanks you.

 I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.

 Almost as well as I do know myself:
To think upon her woes I do protest
That I have wept a hundred several times.

 I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
    She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
When she did think my master loved her well,
She, in my judgement, was as fair as you;
But since she did neglect her looking-glass
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
That now she is become as black as I.

 About my stature; for at Pentecost,
When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
Which served me as fit, by all men's judgements,
As if the garment had been made for me:
Therefore I know she is about my height.
And at that time I made her weep agood,
For I did play a lamentable part:
Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
Which I so lively acted with my tears
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!

 And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
Since she respects my mistress' love so much,
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
Here is her picture; let me see; I think,
If I had such a tire, this face of mine
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
Unless I flatter with myself too much.
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
If that be all the difference in his love,
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
Ay, but her forehead 's low, and mine's as high,
What should it be that he respects in her
But I can make respective in myself,
If this fond love were not a blinded god?
Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
And, were there sense in his idolatry,
My substance should be statue in thy stead.
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes,
To make my master out of love with thee!

Exit.
 But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.

 'Tis true; such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;
For I had rather wink than look on them.

 But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.

 She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.

 True; from a gentleman to a fool.

 That such an ass should owe them.

 Here comes the duke.
Enter DUKE.
 And I will follow, more to cross that love
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
[Exit.
 And me, when he approacheth to your presence.

   Here 'tis; this is it.

 O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.

 And Julia herself did give it me;
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.

 Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
In a disguise of love:
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.

 And I mine.
Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO.
"
71,tgv-8,SILVIA,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-8," Sir Valentine and servant, to you
two thousand.
    I thank you, gentle servant: 'tis very
clerkly done.

 Perchance you think too much of so
much pains?

 A pretty period!   Well, I guess the sequel;
And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
    Yes, yes: the lines are very quaintly writ;
But since unwillingly, take them again.
Nay, take them.

 Ay, ay: you writ them sir, at my request;
But I will none of them; they are for you;
I would have had them writ more movingly.

 And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.

  Why, if it please you, take it for your labor:
And so, good morrow, servant. Exit.
       Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
Upon some other pawn for fealty.

 Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind,
How could he see his way to seek out you?

 Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
[Exit THURIO.
Enter PROTEUS
 His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.

 Too low a mistress for so high a servant.

 And duty never yet did want his meed:
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.

 That you are welcome?

 I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
When you have done, we look to hear from you.

 I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
Who is that that spake?

 Sir Proteus, as I take it.

 What's your will?

 You have your wish; my will is even this:
That presently you hie you home to bed.
Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
To be seduced by thy flattery,
That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
Return, return and make thy love amends.
For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
I am so far from granting thy request
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
And by and by intend to chide myself
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.

 Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,
I am bethroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
To wrong him with thy importunacy?

 And so suppose am I; for in his grave
Assure thyself my love is buried.

 Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence.
Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
   I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
But since your falsehood shall become you well
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
And so, good rest.

 Who calls?

 Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.

 O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd,
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine
Nor how my father would enforce me marry
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say
No grief did ever come so near thy heart
As when thy lady and thy true love died,
Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
I do desire thy worthy company,
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
And on the justice of my flying hence,
To keep me from a most unholy match,
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
I do desire thee, even from a heart
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
To bear me company and go with me:
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
That I may venture to depart alone.

 This evening coming.

 At Friar Patrick's cell,
Where I intend holy confession.

 Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.            [Exeunt severally.
 What would you with her, if that I be she?

 From whom?

 O, he sends you for a picture.

 Ursula, bring my picture there.
Go give your master this: tell him from me,
One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.

 I pray thee, let me look on that again.

 There, hold!
I will not look upon your master's lines:
I know they are stuff'd with protestations
And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
As easily as I do tear his paper.

 The more shame for him that he sends it me;
For I have heard him say a thousand times
His Julia gave it him at his departure.
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.

 What say'st thou?

 Dost thou know her?

 Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.

 Is she not passing fair?

 How tall was she?

 She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
I weep myself to think upon thy words.
Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
Farewell.

[Exit Silvia, with attendants.
 Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
I fear I am attended by some spies.

 A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.

 O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
                                      [Exeunt.
 O miserable, unhappy that I am!

 By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.

 Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
And full as much, for more there cannot be,
I do detest false perjured Proteus.
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.

 When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths.
Descended into perjury, to love me.
Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
And that's far worse than none; better have none
Than plural faith which is too much by one:
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!

 All men but Proteus.

 O heaven!

"
72,tgv-6,LUCETTA,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-6," Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.

 Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
According to my shallow simple skill.

 As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
But, were I you, he never should be mine.

 Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.

 Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!

 Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
That I, unworthy body as I am,
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.

 Then thus: of many good I think him best.

 I have no other but a woman's reason;
I think him so because I think him so.

 Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.

 Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.

 Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.

 O, they love least that let men know their love.

 Peruse this paper, madam.

 That the contents will show.

 Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
Did in your name receive it: pardon the fault I pray.

 To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.

 That you may ruminate. [Exit.
 What would your ladyship?

 I would it were,
That you might kill your stomach on your meat
And not upon your maid.

 Nothing.

 To take a paper up that I let fall.

 Nothing concerning me.

 Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
Unless it have a false interpreter.

 That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
Give me a note: your ladyship can set.

 It is too heavy for so light a tune.

 Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.

 I cannot reach so high.

 Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.

 No, madam; it is too sharp.

 Nay, now you are too flat
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.

 Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.

 She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
To be so anger'd with another letter. [Exit.
 Madam,
Dinner is ready, and your father stays.

 What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?

 Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.

 Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
I see things too, although you judge I wink.

 Alas, the way is wearisome and long!

 Better forbear till Proteus make return.

 I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.

 But in what habit will you go along?

 Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.

 What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?

 You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.

 A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.

 If you think so, then stay at home and go not.

 Then never dream on infamy, but go.
If Proteus like your journey when you come,
No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.

 All these are servants to deceitful men.

 Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!

"
73,duke.,The DUKE OF VENICE,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-duke.," What, is Antonio here?

 I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
Uncapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.

 Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

 Make room, and let him stand before our face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back,
Enow to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

 How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

 Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Come here to-day.

 Bring us the letter; call the messenger.

 Came you from Padua, from Bellario?

 This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court.
Where is he?

 With all my heart. Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

 You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws.
Give me your hand.   Come you from old Bellario?

 You are welcome: take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court?

 Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

 That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state,
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.

 He shall do this, or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here.

 Get thee gone, but do it.

 Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.

 I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
               [Exeunt Duke and his train.
"
74,mor.,The PRINCE OF MOROCCO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-mor.," Mislike me not for my complexion,
The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
To whom I am a neighbor and near bred.
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
And let us make incision for your love,
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine,
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
The best-regarded virgins of our clime
Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

 Even for that I thank you:
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
To try my fortune. By this scimitar
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
Which is the better man, the greater throw
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
So is Alcides beaten by his page;
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
And die with grieving.

 Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.

 Good fortune then!
To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
[Cornets, and exeunt.
 The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
The second, silver, which this promise carries,
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
How shall I know if I do choose the right?

 Some god direct my judgement! Let me see;
I will survey the inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages:
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
And weigh thy value with an even hand:
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
May not extend so far as to the lady:
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
Were but a weak disabling of myself.
As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
In graces and in qualities of breeding;
But more than these, in love I do deserve.
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold;
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
From the four corners of the earth they come,
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia:
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Is't like that lead contains her?   'Twere damnation
To think so base a thought: it were too gross
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
O sinful thought!   Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
But here an angel in a golden bed
Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

 O hell! what have we here?
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
[Reads] All that glisters is not gold;
Often have you heard that told:
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold:
Gilded tombs do worms infold.
Had you been as wise as bold,
Young in limbs, in judgement old,
Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
Fare you well; your suit is cold.
Cold, indeed; and labor lost:
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
[Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets.
"
75,ar.,The PRINCE OF ARRAGON,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-ar.," I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
First, never to unfold to any one
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
Of the right casket, never in my life
To woo a maid in way of marriage:
Lastly,
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
Immediately to leave you and be gone.

 And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
What many men desire that 'many' may be meant
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
Even in the force and road of casualty.
I will not choose what many men desire,
Because I will not jump with common spirits
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
And well said too; for who shall go about
To cozen fortune and be honorable
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.
O, that estates, degrees and offices
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honor
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare!
How many be commanded that command!
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
From the true seed of honor! and how much honor
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
[He opens the silver casket.
 What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?

 What is here?
[Reads] The fire seven times tried this:
Seven times tried that judgement is,
That did never choose amiss.
Some there be that shadows kiss;
Such have but a shadow's bliss:
There be fools alive, I wis,
Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
Take what wife you will to bed,
I will ever be your head:
So be gone: you are sped.
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here
With one fool's head I came to woo,
But I go away with two.
Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
Patiently to bear my wroth.
[Exeunt Arragon and train.
"
76,ant.,ANTONIO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-ant.," In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn;
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
That I have much ado to know myself.

 Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year:
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

 Fie, fie!

 Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it, your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart.

 I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.

 Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.

 Is that any thing now?

 Well, tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
That you to-day promised to tell me of?

 I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
Within the eye of honor, be assured,
My purse, my person, my extremest means,
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.

 You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done,
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.

 Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
Try what my credit can in Venice do:
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
Where money is, and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake.
[Exeunt.
 Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would?

 And for three months.

 I do never use it.

 And what of him? did he take interest?

 This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

 Mark you this, Bassanio,
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

 Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

 I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.

 Content, i' faith; I'll seal to such a bond
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

 Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
Within these two months, that's a month before
This bond expires, I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

 Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

 Hie thee, gentle Jew.
[Exit Shylock.
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.

 Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
My ships come home a month before the day.
[Exeunt.
 Who's there?

 Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
Bassanio presently will go aboard:
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

 Hear me yet, good Shylock.

 I pray thee, hear me speak.

 Let him alone:
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me;
Therefore he hates me.

 The duke cannot deny the course of law:
For the commodity that strangers have
With us in Venice, if it be denied,
Will much impeach the justice of his state;
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
These griefs and losses have so bated me,
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
[Exeunt. Ready, so please your grace.

 I have heard
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
The very tyranny and rage of his.

 I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well do any thing most hard,
As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
Make no more offers, use no farther means,
But with all brief and plain conveniency
Let me have judgement and the Jew his will.

 I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me:
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk.
 Ay, so he says.

 I do.

 Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgement.

 But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honorable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.

 So please my lord the duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
I am content; so he will let me have
The other half in use, to render it,
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter:
Two things provided more, that, for this favor,
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift,
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.

 And stand indebted, over and above,
In love and service to you evermore.

 My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
Let his deservings and my love withal
Be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment.

 No more than I am well acquitted of.

 I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

 I once did lend my body for his wealth;
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.

 Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.

 I am dumb.

 Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road.

"
77,bass.,BASSANIO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-bass.," Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?

 I will not fail you.

  'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate,
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance:
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate; but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
I owe the most, in money and in love,
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

 In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way with more advised watch,
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost; but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

 In Belmont is a lady richly left;
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages:
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,
I have a mind presages me such thrift,
That I should questionless be fortunate!

         Shylock, do you hear?

 This were kindness.

 You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.

 I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.

   One speak for both. What would you?

 I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
The follower of so poor a gentleman.

 Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
Take leave of thy old master and inquire
My lodging out. Give him a livery
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.

 I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.

 Gratiano!

 You have obtain'd it.

 Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
Parts that become thee happily enough
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
But where thou art not known, why, there they show
Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
And lose my hopes.

 Well, we shall see your bearing.

 No, that were pity:
I would entreat you rather to put on
Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
I have some business.

 Let me choose;
For as I am, I live upon the rack.

 None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
There may as well be amity and life
'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.

 Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.

 'Confess' and 'love'
Had been the very sum of my confession:
O happy torment, when my torturer
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

 So may the outward shows be least themselves:
The world is still deceived with ornament.
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
Obscures the show of evil?   In religion,
What damned error, but some sober brow
Will bless it and approve it with a text,
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
There is no vice so simple but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
And these assume but valor's excrement
To render them redoubted!   Look on beauty,
And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
Which therein works a miracle in nature,
Making them lightest that wear most of it:
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
Upon supposed fairness, often known
To be the dowry of a second head,
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
The seeming truth which cunning time puts on
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
And here choose I: joy be the consequence!

 What find I here?
[Opening the leaden casket.
Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
Hath come so near creation?   Move these eyes?
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
Seem they in motion?   Here are sever'd lips,
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
Should sunder such sweet friends.   Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
Faster than gnats in cobwebs: but her eyes,--
How could he see to do them? having made one,
Methinks it should have power to steal both his
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In underprizing it, so far this shadow
Doth limp behind the substance.   Here's the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune.
 Reads You that choose not by the view,
Chance as fair and choose as true!
Since this fortune falls to you,
Be content and seek no new,
If you be well pleased with this
And hold your fortune for your bliss,
Turn you where your lady is
And claim her with a loving kiss.
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
I come by note, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contending in a prize,
That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
Hearing applause and universal shout,
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
Whether those pearls of praise be his or no;
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
As doubtful whether what I see be true,
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you,

 Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
And there is such confusion in my powers,
As after some oration fairly spoke
By a beloved prince, there doth appear
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
Where every something, being blent together,
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
Express'd and not express'd.   But when this ring
Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!

 With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

 And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

  Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
If that the youth of my new interest here
Have power to bid you welcome.   By your leave,
I bid my friends and countrymen,
Sweet Portia, welcome.

 Ere I ope his letter,
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.

 O sweet Portia,
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
When I did first impart my love to you,
I freely told you, all the wealth I had
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
How much I was a braggart. When I told you
My state was nothing, I should then have told you
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
The paper as the body of my friend,
And every word in it a gaping wound,
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
And not one vessel 'scaped the dreadful touch
Of merchant-marring rocks?

 The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
The best condition'd and unwearied spirit
In doing courtesies, and one in whom
The ancient Roman honor more appears
Than any that draws breath in Italy.

 For me three thousand ducats.

  Since I have your good leave to go away,
I will make haste: but, till I come again,
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
[Exeunt. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

 Do all men kill the things they do not love?

 Every offence is not a hate at first.

 For thy three thousand ducats here is six.

 Good cheer, Antonio!   What, man, courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

 Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

 Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority:
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.

 Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you.

 Here is the money.

 I have it ready for thee; here it is.

 Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.

 Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.

 This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
I will not shame myself to give you this.

 There's more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
And find it out by proclamation:
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.

 Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
And when she put it on, she made me vow
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.

 Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.  [Exit Gratiano.
Come, you and I will thither presently;
And in the morning early will we both
Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio. [Exeunt.
 We should hold day with the Antipodes,
If you would walk in absence of the sun.

 I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
This is the man, this is Antonio,
To whom I am so infinitely bound.

 [Aside] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
And swear I lost the ring defending it.

 If I could add a lie unto a fault,
I would deny it; but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

 Sweet Portia,
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
When nought would be accepted but the ring,
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

 No, by my honor, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
Even he that did uphold the very life
Of my dear friend.   What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforced to send it after him;
I was beset with shame and courtesy;
My honor would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
For, by these blessed candles of the night.
Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

 Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
And, in the hearing of these many friends,
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Wherein I see myself--

 Nay, but hear me:
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee.

 By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!

 Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

 Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow:
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

"
78,salan.,SALANIO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-salan.," Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad.   I should be still
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
Would make me sad.

 Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
We leave you now with better company.

 'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
And better in my mind not undertook.

 And so will I.

 The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.

 I never heard a passion so confused,
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.

 Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
Or he shall pay for this.

 You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

 I think he only loves the world for him.
I pray thee, let us go and find him out
And quicken his embraced heaviness
With some delight or other.

 Now, what news on the Rialto?

      "
79,salar.,SALARINO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-salar.," Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
There, where your argosies with portly sail,
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
As they fly by them with their woven wings.

 My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone,
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
And now worth nothing?   Shall I have the thought
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
But tell not me; I know, Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.

 Why, then you are in love.

 Not in love neither?   Then let us say you are sad,
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
Because you are not sad.   Now, by two-headed Janus,
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
And other of such vinegar aspect
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO.
 I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
If worthier friends had not prevented me.

 Good morrow, my good lords.

 We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
[Exeunt Salarino and Salanio. 
 We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.

 Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.

 'Tis good we do so.
[Exeunt Salar. and Salan.
 His hour is almost past.

 O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!

 Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
Enter LORENZO.
 Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
With him is Gratiano gone along;
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.

 He came too late, the ship was under sail:
But there the duke was given to understand
That in a gondola were seen together
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
Besides, Antonio certified the duke
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.

 Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.

 Marry, well remember'd.
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
The French and English, there miscarried
A vessel of our country richly fraught:
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.

 A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
Bassanio told him he would make some speed
Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,
But stay the very riping of the time;
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
Let it not enter in your mind of love:
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
As shall conveniently become you there:'
And even there, his eye being big with tears,
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
And with affection wondrous sensible
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.

 Do we so.
[Exeunt.
  Come, the full stop.

      We have been up and down to seek him.
Enter TUBAL.
 It is the most impenetrable cur
That ever kept with men.

 I am sure the duke
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.

"
80,gra.,GRATIANO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-gra.," You look not well, Signior Antonio;
You have too much respect upon the world:
They lose it that do buy it with much care:
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.

 Let me play the fool:
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
O my Antonio, I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time:
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

 Well, keep me company but two years moe,
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.

 Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
[Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo. 
 Where is your master?

 Signior Bassanio!

 I have a suit to you.

  Signior Bassanio, hear me:
If I do not put on a sober habit,
Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
Use all the observance of civility,
Like one well studied in a sad ostent
To please his grandam, never trust me more.

 Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
By what we do to-night.

 And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
But we will visit you at supper-time. [Exeunt. We have not made good preparation.

 Love-news, in faith.

 Was not that letter from fair Jessica?

 This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
Desired us to make stand.

 And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
For lovers ever run before the clock.

 That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
That he did pace them first? All things that are,
Are with more spirit chased then enjoy'd.
How like a younker or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
How like the prodigal doth she return,
With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

 Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.

 Signior Antonio!

 I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
[Exeunt.
 My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
For I am sure you can wish none from me:
And when your honors mean to solemnize
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
Even at that time I may be married too.

 I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
You loved, I loved for intermission.
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
For wooing here until I sweat again,
And swearing till my very roof was dry
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
I got a promise of this fair one here
To have her love, provided that your fortune
Achieved her mistress.

 Yes, faith, my lord.

  But who comes here?   Lorenzo and his infidel?
What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO,
           a Messenger from Venice. 
 Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
I know he will be glad of our success;
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.

 Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
Of thy sharp envy.   Can no prayers pierce thee?

 O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
And for thy life let justice be accused.
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
That souls of animals infuse themselves
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
Infus'd itself in thee; for thy desires
Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.

 I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
I would she were in heaven, so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.

 O upright judge!   Mark, Jew: O learned judge!

 O learned judge!   Mark, Jew: a learned judge!

 O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!

 A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.

 A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.

 Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.

 A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.

 In christening shalt thou have two godfathers:
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
[Exit Shylock.
 Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en:
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
Your company at dinner.

 That will I do.

 To Ner. By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

 About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
That she did give me, whose posy was
For all the world like cutler's poetry
Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'

 He will, an if he live to be a man.

 Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk,
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
I could not for my heart deny it him.

 My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings.

 Well, do you so: let not me take him, then;
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

 Why, this is like the mending of highways
In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?

 Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

 Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
Whether till the next night she had rather stay
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
                                   [Exeunt."
81,saler.,SALERIO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-saler.," I did, my lord;
And I have reason for it. Signor Antonio
Commends him to you.
                       [Gives Bassanio a letter.
 Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
Will show you his estate.

 I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.

 Not one, my lord.
Besides, it should appear, that if he had
The present money to discharge the Jew,
He would not take it. Never did I know
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
So keen and greedy to confound a man:
He plies the duke at morning and at night,
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
The duke himself, and the magnificoes
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
But none can drive him from the envious plea
Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.

 He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
Enter SHYLOCK.
 My lord, here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
New come from Padua.

"
82,lor.,LORENZO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-lor.," My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.

 Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
For Gratiano never lets me speak.

 Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,
Disguise us at my lodging and return,
All in an hour.

 'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
To furnish us. Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter.
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?

 I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ.

 Whither goest thou?

 Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
I will not fail her; speak it privately.
Go, gentlemen,      [Exit Launcelot.
Will you prepare you for this masque to-night?
I am provided of a torch-bearer.

 Meet me and Gratiano
At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.

 I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
How I shall take her from her father's house,
What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
What page's suit she hath in readiness.
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
Unless she do it under this excuse,
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.
[Exeunt.
 Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
Here dwells my father Jew.   Ho! who's within?
Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes.
 Lorenzo, and thy love.

 Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.

 Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

 So are you, sweet,
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
But come at once;
For the close night doth play the runaway,
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.

 Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
Enter, JESSICA, below.
What, art thou come?   On, gentlemen; away!
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
[Exit with Jessica and Salarino.
Enter ANTONIO.
 I thank your honor. For my part, my lord,
My purpose was not to have seen you here;
But meeting with Salerio by the way,
He did intreat me, past all saying nay,
To come with him along.

 Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
You have a noble and a true conceit
Of god-like amity; which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But if you knew to whom you show this honor,
How true a gentleman you send relief,
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
I know you would be prouder of the work
Than customary bounty can enforce you.

 Madam, with all my heart;
I shall obey you in all fair commands.

 Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!

       O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
The fool hath planted in his memory
An army of good words; and I do know
A many fools, that stand in better place,
Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
Defy the matter. How cheer'st thou, Jessica?
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?

 Even such a husband
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.

 I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.

 No, pray thee, let it serve for tabletalk;
Then, howsoe'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
I shall digest it.

 The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
And they did make no noise, in such a night
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
Where Cressid lay that night.

 In such a night
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
To come again to Carthage.

 In such a night
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
As far as Belmont.

 In such a night
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.

 Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

 A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?

 Who comes with her?

 He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
And ceremoniously let us prepare
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
Enter LAUNCELOT.
 Who calls?

 Leave hollaing, man: here.

 Here.

 Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter: why should we go in?
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
And bring your music forth into the air.
                            [Exit Stephano.
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
Such harmony is in immortal souls;
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
Enter Musicians.
Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn:
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear
And draw her home with music. [Music.
 The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
Which is the hot condition of their blood;
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
Or any air of music touch their ears,
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
But music for the time doth change his nature.
The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
The motions of his spirit are dull as night
And his affections dark as Erebus:
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA.
 That is the voice,
Or I am much deceived, of Portia.

 Dear lady, welcome home.

 Madam, they are not yet;
But there is come a messenger before,
To signify their coming.

 Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.

 Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
Of starved people.

"
83,shy.,SHYLOCK,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-shy.,"         How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him for he is a Christian,
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
If I forgive him!

 I am debating of my present store,
And, by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
Do you desire?  [To Ant.] Rest you fair, good signior;
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.

 Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

 I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.

 When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
The third possessor; ay, he was the third--

 No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
And, when the work of generation was
Between these woolly breeders in the act,
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
Fall parti-color'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.

 I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
But note me, signior.

 Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--

 Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit.
What should I say to you? Should I not say
'Hath a dog money? is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
With bated breath and whispering humbleness,
Say this;
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
You spurn'd me such a day; another time
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?

 Why, look you, how you storm!
I would be friends with you and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
Supply your present wants and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
This is kind I offer.

 This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.

 O father Abram, what these Christians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
If he should break his day, what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.   I say,
To buy his favor, I extend this friendship:
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

 Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond,
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
See to my house, left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
I will be with you.

 Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
As thou hast done with me: What, Jessica!--
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
Why, Jessica, I say!

 Who bids thee call?   I do not bid thee call.

 I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
For I did dream of money-bags to-night.

 So do I his.

 What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
Clamber not you up to the casements then,
Nor thrust your head into the public street
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
Say I will come.

 What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?

 The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
More than the wild-cat; drones hive not with me;
Therefore I part with him, and part with him
To one that I would have him help to waste
His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
Perhaps I will return immediately:
Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
Fast bind, fast find;
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind. [Exit.
  She is damned for it.

 My own flesh and blood to rebel!

 I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.

     What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?

       Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
Gaoler, look to him.

 I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
To come abroad with him at his request.

 I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
To Christian inercessors. Follow not;
I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
[Exit.
 I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
But, say, it is my humor: is it answer'd?
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it baned?   What, are you answer'd yet?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend, himself being offended;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

 I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

 Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

 What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

 If every ducat in six thousand ducats
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.

 What judgement shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
Be season'd with such viands?   You will answer
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for judgement: answer; shall I have it?

 To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

 No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

 Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
To cureless ruin.   I stand here for law.

 Shylock is my name.

 On what compulsion must I? tell me that.

 My deeds upon my head!   I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

 A Daniel come to judgement! yea, a Daniel!
O wise young judge, how I do honor thee!

 Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

 An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not, for Venice.

 When it is paid according to the tenor.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgement: by my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.

 O noble judge!   O excellent young man!

 'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

 Ay, his breast:
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.

 I have them ready.

 Is it so nominated in the bond?

 I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.

 These be the Christian husbands.   I have a daughter;
Would any of the stock of Barrabas
Had been her husband rather than a Christian! [Aside.
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.

 Most rightful judge!

 Most learned judge!   A sentence! Come, prepare!

 Is that the law?

 I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
And let the Christian go.

 Give me my principal, and let me go.

 Shall I not have barely my principal?

 Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.

 Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live.

 I am content.

 I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
I am not well: send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.

By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours.

 None but a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray you, is my master yet return'd?

"
90,por.,PORTIA,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-por.,"                In terms of choice I am not solely led
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
Besides, the lottery of my destiny
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
But if my father had not scanted me
And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
His wife who wins me by that means I told you
Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
As any comer I have look'd on yet
For my affection.

 You must take your chance,
And either not attempt to choose at all
Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.

 First, forward to the temple: after dinner
Your hazard shall be made.

 Go draw aside the curtains and discover
The several caskets to this noble prince.
Now make your choice.

 The one of them contains my picture, prince:
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

 There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
Then I am yours.
[He unlocks the golden casket.
 A gentle riddance.   Draw the curtains, go.
Let all of his complexion choose me so.
[Exeunt.
 Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
You must be gone from hence immediately.

 To these injunctions every one doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.

 Too long a pause for that which you find there.

 To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
And of opposed natures.

 Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

 Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
Enter a Servant.
 Here: what would my lord?

 No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.

 I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
I lose your company: therefore forbear a while.
There's something tells me, but it is not love,
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
Hate counsels not in such a quality.
But lest you should not understand me well,--
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
I would detain you here some month or two
Before you venture for me. I could teach you
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
So will I never be: so may you miss me;
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
That I had been forsworn.   Beshrew your eyes,
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
And so all yours. O, these naughty times
Put bars between the owners and their rights!
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
To eke it and to draw it out in length,
To stay you from election.

 Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
What treason there is mingled with your love.

 Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
Where men enforced do speak anything.

 Well then, confess and live.

 Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
If you do love me, you will find me out.
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
Fading in music: that the comparison
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
And watery death-bed for him.   He may win;
And what is music then?   Then music is
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
To a new-crowned monarch; such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
With no less presence, but with much more love,
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice;
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
With bleared visages, come forth to view
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself.
SONG.
Tell me where is fancy bred,
Or in the heart, or in the head?
How begot, how nourished?
Reply, reply.
It is engender'd in the eyes,
With gazing fed; and fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring fancy's knell:
I'll begin it--Ding, dong, bell.

 [Aside] How all the other passions fleet to air,
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy!
O love,
Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
For fear I surfeit.

 You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
Such as I am: though for myself alone
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
To wish myself much better; yet, for you
I would be trebled twenty times myself;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times
More rich;
That only to stand high in your account,
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
Exceed account; but the full sum of me
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
Happy in this, she is not yet so old
But she may learn; happier than this,
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed,
As from her lord, her governor, her king.
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted: but now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
This house, these servants and this same myself
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
Let it presage the ruin of your love
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

 Is this true, Nerissa?

 So do I, my lord:
They are entirely welcome.

 There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
That steals the color from Bassanio's cheek:
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
Could turn so much the constitution
Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
With leave, Bassanio; I am half yourself,
And I must freely have the half of anything
That this same paper brings you.

 Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

 What sum owes he the Jew?

 What, no more?
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
Double six thousand, and then treble that,
Before a friend of this description
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife,
And then away to Venice to your friend;
For never shall you lie by Portia's side
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.

 O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!

 I never did repent for doing good,
Nor shall not now: for in companions
That do converse and waste the time together,
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
Being the bosom lover of my lord,
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
How little is the cost I have bestow'd
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish misery!
This comes too near the praising of myself;
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
The husbandry and manage of my house
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
To live in prayer and contemplation,
Only attended by Nerissa here,
Until her husband and my lord's return:
There is a monastery two miles off;
And there will we abide. I do desire you
Not to deny this imposition;
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you.

 My people do already know my mind,
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
And so farewell, till we shall meet again.

 I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
To wish it back on you: fare you well, Jessica.
[Exeunt Jessica and Lorenzo.
Now, Balthasar,
As I have ever found thee honest-true,
So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
And use thou all the endeavour of a man
In speed to Padua: see thou render this
Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
Unto the tranect; to the common ferry
Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.

 Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
Before they think of us.

 They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
That they shall think we are accomplished
With that we lack.   I'll hold thee any wager,
When we are both accoutred like young men,
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
And speak between the change of man and boy
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
How honorable ladies sought my love,
Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
And wish, for all that, that I had not kill'd them;
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
That men shall swear I have discontinued school
Above a twelvemonth.   I have within my mind
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
Which I will practise.

 Fie, what a question's that,
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
When I am in my coach, which stays for us
At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
[Exeunt.
 I did, my lord.

 I am informed throughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?

 Is your name Shylock?

 Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger, do you not?

 Do you confess the bond?

 Then must the Jew be merciful.

 The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

 Is he not able to discharge the money?

 It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.

 I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

 Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.

 Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.

 Why then, thus it is:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

 For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty,
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.

 Therefore lay bare your bosom.

 It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh?

 Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death.

 It is not so express'd: but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

 You, merchant, have you any thing to say?

 Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.

 A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.

 And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.

 Tarry a little; there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate'
Unto the state of Venice.

 Thyself shalt see the act:
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.

 Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
He shall have nothing but the penalty.

 Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
But in the estimation of a hair,
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.

 Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.

 He hath refused it in the open court:
He shall have merely justice and his bond.

 Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

 Tarry, Jew:
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen,
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly and directly too
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.

 Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.

 What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

 Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?

 Clerk, draw a deed of gift.

 I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
I must away this night toward Padua,
And it is meet I presently set forth.

 He is well paid that is well satisfied;
And I, delivering you, am satisfied
And therein do account myself well paid:
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you, know me when we meet again:
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.

 You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
[To Ant.] Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
[To Bass.] And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
And you in love shall not deny me this.

 I will have nothing else but only this;
And now methinks I have a mind to it.

 I see, sir, you are liberal in offers:
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.

 That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
And know how well I have deserved the ring,
She would not hold out enemy for ever,
For giving it to me.   Well, peace be with you!
[Exeunt Portia and Nerissa. 
 Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
And be a day before our husbands home:
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
Enter GRATIANO.
 That cannot be:
His ring I do accept most thankfully:
And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.

 [Aside to Ner.] Thou mayst, I warrant. We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men;
But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
[Aloud] Away! make haste: thou know'st where I will tarry.

 That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

 So doth the greater glory dim the less:
A substitute shines brightly as a king
Until a king be by, and then his state
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!

 Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

 The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
When neither is attended, and I think
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season season'd are
To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
And would not be awaked. [Music ceases.
 He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
By the bad voice.

 We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
Are they return'd?

 Go in, Nerissa;
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence;
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
                [A tucket sounds.
 This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers.
 Let me give light, but let me not be light;
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
And never be Bassanio so for me:
But God sort all!   You are welcome home, my lord.

 You should in all sense be much bound to him,
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

 Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
It must appear in other ways than words,
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

 A quarrel, ho, already what's the matter?

 You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it; and here he stands;
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
That the world masters.   Now, in faith, Gratiano,
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

 What ring gave you, my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

 Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
Until I see the ring.

 If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
Or your own honor to contain the ring,
You would not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so much unreasonable,
If you had pleased to have defended it
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

 Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you;
I'll not deny him any thing I have,
No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
If you do not, if I be left alone,
Now, by mine honor, which is yet mine own,
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

 Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.

 Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
And there's an oath of credit.

 Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other.

 I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

 Speak not so grossly.   You are all amazed:
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
And even but now return'd; I have not yet
Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
And I have better news in store for you
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
There you shall find three of your argosies
Are richly come to harbor suddenly:
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter.

 How now, Lorenzo!
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.

 It is almost morning.
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these events at full. Let us go in;
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
And we will answer all things faithfully.

The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
And comes to his election presently.
Flourish of cornets.   Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their trains.

 The ancient saying is no heresy,
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.

 Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!
[Exeunt.
 My lord and lady, it is now our time,
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!

 Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.

 What, and stake down?

 Shall they see us?

 Why, shall we turn to men?

 From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
[Presenting a letter. 
 He attendeth here hard by,
To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.

 'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The wish would make else an unquiet house.

 Sir, I would speak with you.
[Aside to Por.] I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.

 Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
[Exeunt. 
 When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.

 It is your music, madam, of the house.

 Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

 What talk you of the posy or the value?
You swore to me, when I did give it you,
That you would wear it till your hour of death
And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
You should have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.

 Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

 Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine.

 And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection.

 And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

 Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
Unless he live until he be a man.

 Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
There do I give to you and Jessica,
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.

"
92,jes.,JESSICA,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-jes.," I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
Give him this letter; do it secretly;
And so farewell: I would not have my father
See me in talk with thee.

 Farewell, good Launcelot.
 [Exit Launcelot.
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
To be ashamed to be my father's child!
But though I am a daughter to his blood,
I am not to his manners.   O Lorenzo,
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
Become a Christian and thy loving wife. [Exit.
 Call you? what is your will?

 His words were 'Farewell, mistress;' nothing else.

 Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
I have a father, you a daughter, lost. [Exit.
 Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

 Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
For who love I so much? And now who knows
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

 Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit;
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy.

 What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
And I should be obscured.

 I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
[Exit above. 
 When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
Than twenty times the value of the sum
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord.
If law, authority and power deny not,
It will go hard with poor Antonio.

 I wish your ladyship all heart's content.

 And what hope is that, I pray thee?

     Past all expressing.   It is very meet
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
For, having such a blessing in his lady,
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
And if on earth he do not mean it, then
In reason he should never come to heaven.
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
And on the wager lay two earthly women,
And Portia one, there must be something else
Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
Hath not her fellow.

 Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.

 Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.

 Well, I'll set you forth.

And ran dismay'd away.

Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
And ne'er a true one.

But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.

And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
Since now we will divest us, both of rule,
Interest of territory, cares of state,--
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
That our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
Our eldest-born, speak first.


 Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
With shadowy forest and with champains rich'd,
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
Be this perpetual.   What says our second daughter,
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.

 To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
Although the last, not least; to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

   How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
Lest it may mar your fortunes.

 But goes thy heart with this?

  So young, and so untender?

 Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
Propinquity and property of blood,
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
As thou my sometime daughter.

 Peace, Kent.
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
So be my grave my peace, as here I give
Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
I do invest you jointly with my power,
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
With reservation of an hundred knights,
By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
The name, and all the additions to a king;
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
This coronet part betwixt you.
                               [Giving the crown.
  The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.

 Kent, on thy life, no more.

 Out of my sight!

 Now, by Apollo,--

 O, vassal! miscreant!
                [Laying his hand on his sword.
 Hear me, recreant!
On thine allegiance, hear me!
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
To come between our sentence and our power,
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
Our potency made good, take thy reward.
Five days we do allot thee, for provision
To shield thee from diseases of the world;
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
This shall not be revoked.

 My lord of Burgundy,
We first address towards you, who with this king
Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
Will you require in present dower with her,
Or cease your quest of love?

 Right noble Burgundy,
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
If aught within that little seeming substance,
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
She's there, and she is yours.

 Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
Take her, or leave her?

 Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great king,
I would not from your love make such a stray,
To match you where I hate! therefore beseech you
To avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
Almost to acknowledge hers.

 Better thou
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.

  Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.

 Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
Without our grace, our love, our benison.
Come, noble Burgundy.
            [Flourish.Exeunt all but France,
                 Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia.
                                   Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:
Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
Either his notion weakens, his discernings
Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
Who is it that can tell me who I am?

   Darkness and devils!
Saddle my horses; call my train together.
Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee:
Yet have I left a daughter.

 Woe, that too late repents,--[To
Alb.] O, sir, are you come?
Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
Than the sea-monster!

 Detested kite! thou liest.
My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
That all particulars of duty know,
And in the most exact regard support
The worships of their name. O most small fault,
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love,
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,
                              [Striking his head.
And thy dear judgement out!   Go, go, my people.

 It may be so, my lord.
Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!
Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
To make this creature fruitful!
Into her womb convey sterility!
Dry up in her the organs of increase;
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her!  If she must teem,
Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
To have a thankless child! Away, away!
                                            [Exit.
 What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
Within a fortnight!

 I'll tell thee: [To Gon.] Life and death!  I am ashamed
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
The untented woundings of a father's curse
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?
Let it be so: yet have I left a daughter,
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
When she shall hear this of thee, with her
nails
She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever: thou shalt, I warrant thee.
        [Exeunt Lear, Kent, and Attendants.
             O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
Enter Gentleman.
  'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
And not send back my messenger.

 Ha!
Makest thou this shame thy pastime?

 What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here?

     They durst not do't;
They could not, would not do't; 'tis worse than murder,
To do upon respect such violent outrage:
Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
Thou might'st deserve, or they impose, this usage,
Coming from us.

 O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
Thy element's below!   Where is this daughter?

 Follow me not;
Stay here.

 Deny to speak with me?   They are sick? they are weary?
They have travell'd all the night?   Mere fetches;
The images of revolt and flying off.
Fetch me a better answer.

 Vengeance!   plague! death! confusion!
Fiery?   what quality?   Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
I'll speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

  The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
Are they inform'd of this?   My breath and blood!
Fiery? the fiery duke?   Tell the hot duke that--
No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
To take the indisposed and sickly fit
For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore               [Looking on Kent.
Should he sit here?   This act persuades me
That this remotion of the duke and her
Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death.

  O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!

 Good morrow to you both.

 Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
Sepulchring an adultress.   [To Kent] O, are you free?
Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:
                           [Points to his heart.
I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
With how depraved a quality--O Regan!

 Say, how is that?

 My curses on her!

 Ask her forgiveness?
Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;
                                       [Kneeling.
Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'

 [Rising] Never, Regan:
She hath abated me of half my train;
Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top!   Strike her young bones,
You taking airs, with lameness!

 You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes!   Infect her beauty,
You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
To fall and blast her pride!

 No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
Thy tender-defted nature shall not give
Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in: thou better know'st
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot
Wherein I thee endow'd.

 Who put my man i' the stocks?
                                 [Tucket within.

 This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
Out, varlet, from my sight!

 Who stock'd my servant?   Regan, I have good hope
Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,
Enter GONERIL.
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!
 [To Gon.] Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?

 O sides, you are too tough;
Will you yet hold?   How came my man i' the stocks?

 You! did you?

 Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
To wage against the enmity o' the air;
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
Necessity's sharp pinch!   Return with her?
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom. [Pointing at Oswald.
 I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
I and my hundred knights.

 Is this well spoken?

 I gave you all--

 Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
But kept a reservation to be follow'd
With such a number. What, must I come to you
With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?

 Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
When others are more wicked; not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise.   [To Gon.] I'll go with thee:
Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
And thou art twice her love.

 O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
Are in the poorest things superfluous:
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
If only to go warm were gorgeous,
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
Against their father, fool me not so much
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
Stain my man's cheeks!   No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges on you both,
That all the world shall--I will do such things--
What they are, yet I know not; but they shall be
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;
No, I'll not weep:
I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
    [Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool.
Storm and tempest.
 Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
Singe my white head!   And thou, all-shaking thunder,
Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
Crack nature's moulds, all germens spill at once,
That make ingrateful man!

 Rumble thy bellyful!   Spit, fire! spout, rain!
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
I tax not you, you elements with unkindness;
I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
You owe me no subscription: then let fall
Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,
A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:
But yet I call you servile ministers,
That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!

 No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
I will say nothing.
Enter KENT.
 Let the great gods,
That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue
That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
That under covert and convenient seeming
Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
Rive your concealing continents, and cry
These dreadful summoners grace.   I am a man
More sinn'd against than sinning.

 My wits begin to turn.
Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
I am cold myself.   Where is this straw, my fellow?
The art of our necessities is strange,
That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.
Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
That's sorry yet for thee.

  Let me alone.

 Wilt break my heart?

 Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
But where the greater malady is fix'd,
The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the mind's free,
The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food to 't? But I will punish home:
No, I will weep no more. In such a night
To shut me out!   Pour on; I will endure.
Tn such a night as this!   O Regan, Goneril!
Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave
all,--
O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
No more of that.

 Prithee, go in thyself; seek thine own ease:
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
 [To the Fool] In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--
Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
                                   [Fool goes in.
Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
And show the heavens more just.

 Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
And art thou come to this?

 What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?

 Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy
daughters!

 Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
Those pelican daughters.

    First let me talk with this philosopher.
What is the cause of thunder?

 I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
What is your study?

  O, cry you mercy, sir.
Noble philosopher, your company.

 Come, let's in all.

 With him;
I will keep still with my philosopher.

   To have a thousand with red burning spits
Come hissing in upon 'em,--

 It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
[To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;
 [To the Fool] Thou, sapient sir, sit here.
Now, you she foxes!

 I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
 [To Edgar] Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;
[To the Fool] And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
Bench by his side: [To Kent] you are o' the commission,
Sit you too.

   And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
What store her heart is made on.   Stop her there!
Arms, arms, sword, fire!   Corruption in the place!
False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?

 The little dogs and all,
Tray, Blanch, and Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.

   No, they cannot touch me for coining;
I am the king himself.

    Ay, every inch a king:
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
Adultery?
Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly
Does lecher in my sight.
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
Behold yond simpering dame,
Whose face between her forks presages snow;
That minces virtue, and does shake the head
To hear of pleasure's name;
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
With a more riotous appetite.
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
Though women all above:
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
Beneath is all the fiends';
There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit,
      Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
And, like a scurvy politician, seem
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.

 If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
Thou know'st the first time that we smell the air,
We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.

 When we are born, we cry that we are come
To this great stage of fools: this' a good block;
It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
A troop of horse with felt: I'll put't in proof;
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants.
 No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
I am cut to the brains.

 No seconds? all myself?
Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
Ay, and laying autumn's dust.

 I will die bravely, like a bridegroom.
What!
I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,
My masters, know you that.

  You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
Do scald like molten lead.

  You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?

 Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
To see another thus. I know not what to say.
I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
Of my condition!

 Pray, do not mock me:
I am a very foolish fond old man,
Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
And, to deal plainly,
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant
What place this is; and all the skill I have
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
For, as I am a man, I think this lady
To be my child Cordelia.

 Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith.   I pray, weep not:
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
I know you do not love me; for your sisters
Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
You have some cause, they have not.

 Am I in France?

  Do not abuse me.

 You must bear with me:
Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
        [Exeunt all but Kent and Gentleman.
 No, no, no, no!   Come, let's away to prison:
We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
And take upon's the mystery of things,
As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
That ebb and flow by the moon.

 Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
The gods themselves throw incense.   Have I caught thee?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve first.
Come. [Exeunt Lear and Cordelia, guarded.
 Howl, howl, howl, howl!   O, you are men of stones:
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
She's dead as earth.   Lend me a looking-glass;
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
Why, then she lives.

 This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
That ever I have felt.
 Prithee, away.

 A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
What is't thou say'st?   Her voice was ever soft,
Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.

 Did I not, fellow?
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip: I am old now,
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
Mine eyes are not o' the best:   I'll tell you straight.

  He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.

  I'll see that straight.

 You are welcome hither.

 Ay, so I think.

 And my poor fool is hang'd!   No, no, no life!
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
Never, never, never, never, never!
Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
Do you see this?   Look on her, look, her lips,
Look there, look there!                    [Dies.
"
97,lr-6,KING OF FRANCE,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-6," This is most strange,
That she, that even but now was your best object,
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
So many folds of favor. Sure, her offence
Must be of such unnatural degree,
That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Could never plant in me.

 Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
What say you to the lady? Love's not love
When it is mingled with regards that stand
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
She is herself a dowry.

 Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
Thee and thy virtues I seize upon:
Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
Thou losest here, a better where to find.

 Bid farewell to your sisters.

 Come, my fair Cordelia.
                  [Exeunt France and Cordelia.

I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
Nor will you tender less.

 I know no answer.

 Pardon me, royal sir;
Election makes not up on such conditions.

 Royal Lear,
Give but this portion which yourself proposed,
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
Duchess of Burgundy.

 I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband.

"
99,lr-4,DUKE OF CORNWALL,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-4," Dear sir, forbear.

 How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news,

 Nor I, I assure thee, Regan.
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
A child-like office.

 Is he pursued?

 If he be taken, he shall never more
Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
You we first seize on.

  You know not why we came to visit you,--

          This is some fellow,
Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
An honest mind and plain, he must speak
truth!
An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain:
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
Than twenty silly ducking observants
That stretch their duties nicely.

 What mean'st by this?

  Fetch forth the stocks!
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
We'll teach you--

 Fetch forth the stocks!   As I have life and honor,
There shall he sit till noon.

 This is a fellow of the self-same color
Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!                 [Stocks brought out.
 I'll answer that.

 Hail to your grace.
                          [Kent is set at liberty.
 Fie, sir, fie!

 What trumpet's that?

 What means your grace?

 I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
Deserved much less advancement.

  Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.
Re-enter GLOUCESTER.
 Whither is he going?

  'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.

 Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:
My Regan counsels well: come out o' the storm.                              
                  [Exeunt.        Get horses for your mistress.

 Edmund, farewell.

Though well we may not pass upon his life
Without the form of justice, yet our power
Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?
Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three.
  Bind him, I say. [Servants bind him.
  To this chair bind him.   Villain, thou shalt find-- [Regan plucks his beard.
  And what confederacy have you with the traitors
Late footed in the kingdom?

 Cunning.

  Where hast thou sent the king?

  Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.

 See't shalt thou never.   Fellows, hold the chair.
Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.

 If you see vengeance,--

 My villain! [They draw and fight.
 Lest it see more, prevent it.   Out, vile jelly!
Where is thy lustre now?

 I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.

"
100,lr-1,DUKE OF ALBANY,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-1," Dear sir, forbear.

 Pray, sir, be patient.
 My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
Of what hath moved you.

  Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?

 What's the matter, sir?

 I cannot be so partial, Goneril.
To the great love I bear you,--

 Well, you may fear too far.

 How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell:
Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.

  O Goneril!
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face.   I fear your disposition:
That nature, which contemns it origin,
Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap, perforce must wither
And come to deadly use.

 Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
A father, and a gracious aged man,
Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
It will come,
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
Like monsters of the deep.

 See thyself, devil!
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman.

 Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
To let these hands obey my blood,
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
A woman's shape doth shield thee.

 What news?

 Gloucester's eyes!

 This shows you are above,
You justicers, that these our nether crimes
So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester
Lost he his other eye?

 Where was his son when they did take his eyes?

 He is not here.

 Knows he the wickedness?

 Gloucester, I live
To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
Tell me what more thou know'st.   [Exeunt.
 Our very loving sister, well be-met.
Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
With others whom the rigour of our state
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
I never yet was valiant: for this business,
It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
Not bolds the king, with others, whom I fear,
Most just and heavy causes make oppose.

 Let's then determine
With the ancient of war on our proceedings.

 I'll overtake you. Speak.
           [Exeunt all but Albany and Edgar.
 Stay till I have read the letter.

  Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.                 [Exit Edgar. 
Re-enter EDMUND.
 We will greet the time.   [Exit.
 Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
And fortune led you well: you have the captives
That were the opposites of this day's strife:
We do require them of you, so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine.

 Sir, by your patience,
I hold you but a subject of this war,
Not as a brother.

  The let-alone lies not not in your good will.

 Half-blooded fellow, yes.
 Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
This gilded serpent [pointing to Gon.]. For your claim, fair sister,
I bar it in the interest of my wife:
'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
If you will marry, make your loves to me,
My lady is bespoke.

  Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the
trumpet sound:
If none appear to prove upon thy head
Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
There is my pledge [throwing down a glove];
 I'll prove it on thy heart,
Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
Than I have here proclaim'd thee.

 A herald, ho!

 Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
All levied in my name, have in my name
Took their discharge.

 She is not well; convey her to my tent.      [Exit Regan, led.
Enter a Herald.
Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,--
And read out this.

 Ask him his purposes, why he appears
Upon this call o' the trumpet.

 Which is that adversary?

 Save him, save him!

 Shut your mouth, dame,
Or with this paper shall I stop it. Hold, sir;
Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
No tearing, lady; I perceive you know it.
                  [Gives the letter to Edmund.
 Most monstrous! oh!
Know'st thou this paper?

  Methought thy very gait did prophesy
A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
Did hate thee or thy father!

 Where have you hid yourself?
How have you known the miseries of your father?

 If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
For I am almost ready to dissolve,
Hearing of this.

 But who was this?

 Speak, man.

  Who dead? speak, man.

 Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
Touches us not with pity. [Exit Gentleman,
Enter KENT.
O, is this he?
The time will not allow the compliment
Which very manners urges.

 Great thing of us forgot!
Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
See'st thou this object, Kent?
        [The bodies of Goneril and Regan are
                                      brought in.
  Run, run, O, run!

Re-enter LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR, Captain, and others following.
 Fall, and cease!

 He knows not what he says: and vain it is
That we present us to him.

 That's but a trifle here,
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
What comfort to this great decay may come
Shall be applied: for us, we will resign,
During the life of this old majesty,
To him our absolute power: [To Edgar and Kent] you, to your rights;
With boot, and such addition as your honors
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
The wages of their virtue, and all foes
The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!

 Bear them from hence. Our present business
Is general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you twain
Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.

 The weight of this sad time we must obey;
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
Shall never see so much, nor live so long.

101,lr-9,EARL OF KENT,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-9,"      Good my liege,--

 Royal Lear,
Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--

 Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
When power to flattery bows?   To plainness honour's bound,
When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
And, in thy best consideration, check
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement,
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
Reverbs no hollowness.

 My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
Thy safety being the motive.

 See better, Lear; and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye.

 Now, by Apollo, king,
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.

 Do;
Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.

 Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
[To Cordelia]The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
[To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
That good effects may spring from words of love.
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
He'll shape his old course in a country new.
                                           [Exit.
Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with
FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants.
 If but as well I other accents borrow,
 That can my speech defuse, my good intent
 May carry through itself to that full issue
 For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
 If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
 So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,
 Shall find thee full of labours.

Horns within.Enter LEAR, Knights, and Attendants.
                              That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
Who wears no honesty.   Such smelling rogues as these,
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain
Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel;
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters,
Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.

 No contraries hold more antipathy
Than I and such a knave.

  Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
I have seen better faces in my time
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Before me at this instant.

 Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
Under the allowance of your great aspect,
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
On flickering Phoebus' front,--

  None of these rogues and cowards
But Ajax is their fool.

 Sir, I am too old to learn:
Call not for your stocks for me: I serve the king;
On whose employment I was sent to you:
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
Against the grace and person of my master,
Stocking his messenger.

 Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
You should not use me so.

 Pray do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;
Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
Give you good morrow!

 Good king, that must approve the common saw,
That out of heaven's benediction comest
To the warm sun!
Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
That by thy comfortable beams I may
Peruse this letter!   Nothing almost sees miracles
But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
Of my obscured course; and shall find time
From this enormous state, seeking to give
Losses their remedies. All weary and o'er-
watch'd,
Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
This shameful lodging.
Fortune, good night: smile once more; turn thy wheel!                          [Sleeps. Hail to thee, noble master!

 No, my lord.

 It is both he and she;
Your son and daughter.

    By Juno, I swear, ay.

 My lord, when at their home
I did commend your highness' letters to them,
Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
From Goneril his mistress salutations;
Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
Which presently they read: on whose contents,
They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
Commanded me to follow, and attend
The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
And meeting here the other messenger,
Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
Being the very fellow that of late
Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
Having more man than wit about me, drew:
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers.

 With the earl, sir, here within.

 None.
How chance the king comes with so small a train?

     But who is with him?

 Sir, I do know you;
And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
Which are to France the spies and speculations
Intelligent to our state; what hath been seen,
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
But, true it is, from France there comes a power
Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
In some of our best ports, and are at point
To show their open banner.   Now to you:
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
Some that will thank you, making just report
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The king hath cause to plain.
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
And, from   some knowledge and assurance, offer
This office to you.

 No, do not.
For confirmation that I am much more
Than my out-wall, open this purse and take
What it contains.   If you shall see Cordelia,--
As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;
And she will tell you who your fellow is
That yet you do not know.   Fie on this storm!
I will go seek the king.

 Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
That, when we have found the king,--in which, your pain
That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
Holla the other.              [Exeunt severally.
  Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night
Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
And make them keep their caves: since I was man,
Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
The affliction nor the fear.

 Alack, bare-headed!
Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
Repose thou there; while I to this hard house--
More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;
Which even but now, demanding after you,
Denied me to come in--return, and force
Their scanted courtesy.

 Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:
The tyranny of the open night's too rough
For nature to endure.              [Storm still.
 Good my lord, enter here.

  I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.

 Good my lord, enter here.

       Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.

 Importune him once more to go, my lord;
His wits begin to unsettle.

 This way, my lord.

    How do you, sir?   Stand you not so amazed:
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?

 O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
That you so oft have boasted to retain?

   Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.

 Oppressed nature sleeps:
This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
Which, if convenience will not allow,
Stand in hard cure. [To the Fool] Come, help to bear thy master;
Thou must not stay behind.

    O, then it moved her.

 Made she no verbal question?

 It is the stars.
The stars above us, govern our conditions;
Else one self mate and mate could not beget
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?

 Was this before the king return'd?

 Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
What we are come about, and by no means
Will yield to see his daughter.

 A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
His mind so venomously, that burning shame
Detains him from Cordelia.

  Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers
you heard not?

 Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
Along with me.                        [Exeunt.
 To   be acknowledged, madam, is o'er-paid.
All my reports go with the modest truth;
Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.

 Pardon me, dear madam;
Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
My boon I make it, that you know me not
Till time and I think meet.

 Kind and dear princess!

 In your own kingdom, sir.

  As 'tis said, the bastard son of
Gloucester.

  My point and period will be thoroughly wrought,
Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.
                                            [Exit. I am come
To bid my king and master aye good night:
Is he not here?

 Alack, why thus?

 Is this the promised end?

  If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
One of them we behold.

 The same,
Your servant Kent.   Where is your servant Caius?

  No, my good lord; I am the very man,--

 That, from your first of difference and decay,
Have follow'd your sad steps.

 Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
And desperately are dead.

 Break, heart; I prithee, break!

 Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
That would upon the rack of this tough world
Stretch him out longer.

 The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
He but usurp'd his life.

 I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
My master calls me, I must not say no.

Confined to exhibition! All this done

                But where is he?

 Where is the villain, Edmund?

 Pursue him, ho! Go after.   [Exeunt
       some Servants.] By no means what?

 Let him fly far:
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
By his authority I will proclaim it,
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
He that conceals him, death.

 Strong and fasten'd villain!
Would he deny his letter?   I never got him.
                                 [Tucket within.
Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
May have due note of him; and of my land,
Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
To make thee capable.
Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants.
   He did bewray his practice; and received
This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

 Ay, my good lord.

 For him I thank your grace.

 I serve you, madam:
Your graces are right welcome.        [Exeunt.
  How fell you out? say that.

 Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
His fault is much, and the good king his master
Will check him for't: your purposed low correction
Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
For pilferings and most common trespasses
Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
That he's so slightly valued in his messenger.
Should have him thus restrain'd.

 I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,
Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
Will not be rubb'd nor stopped: I'll entreat for thee.

  The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.                           [Exit.
 My dear lord,
You know the fiery quality of the duke;
How unremoveable and fix'd he is
In his own course.

   I would have all well betwixt you.
                                           [Exit.
 The king is in high rage.

  He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.

 Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about
There's scarce a bush.

     Our flesh and blood is grown so vile,
my lord,
That it doth hate what gets it.

 Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:
Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,
And bring you where both fire and food is ready.

 Canst thou blame him? [Storm still.
His daughters seek his death; ah, that good Kent!
He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend.
I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
Now outlaw'd from my blood: he sought my life,
But lately, very late: I loved him, friend:
No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,
The grief hath crazed my wits.   What a night's this!
I do beseech your grace,--

  In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.

     Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?

 Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;
I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,
And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:
If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;
And follow me, that will to some provision
Give thee quick conduct.

 Come, come, away.
                         [Exeunt all but Edgar.
 What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider
You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.

  Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.

 By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
To pluck me by the beard.

 Naughty lady,
These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?

 I have a letter guessingly set down,
Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
And not from one opposed.

  To Dover.

  I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.

 Because I would not see thy cruel nails
Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
And quench'd the stelled fires:
Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
The winged vengeance overtake such children.

 He that will think to live till he be old,
Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!

 All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
To quit this horrid act.

 O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!

 Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:
Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
Thee they may hurt.

 I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,
Our means secure us, and our mere defects
Prove our commodities.   O dear son Edgar,
The food of thy abused father's wrath!
Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
I'ld say I had eyes again!

 Is it a beggar-man?

 He has some reason, else he could not beg.
I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
Which made me think a man a worm: my son
Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard more since.
As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods,
They kill us for their sport.

 Is that the naked fellow?

 Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,
Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
And bring some covering for this naked soul,
Who I'll entreat to lead me.

 'Tis the times' plague, when mad-men lead the blind.
Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
Above the rest, be gone.

    Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;
So distribution should undo excess,
And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?

 There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
Bring me but to the very brim of it,
And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
With something rich about me: from that place
I shall no leading need.

  When shall we come to the top of that same hill?

 Methinks the ground is even.

 No, truly.

 So may it be, indeed:
Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.

       Methinks you're better spoken.

 Set me where you stand.

 Let go my hand.
Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
Prosper it with thee   Go thou farther off;
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

 With all my heart.

 [Kneeling]O, you mighty gods!
This world I do renounce, and in your sights,
Shake patiently my great affliction off:
If I could bear it longer, and not fall
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
My snuff and loathed part of nature should
Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
Now, fellow, fare thee well. [He falls forward.
 Away, and let me die.

  Alack, I have no eyes.
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
To end itself by death?   'Twas yet some comfort,
When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
And frustrate his proud will.

 Too well, too well.

 A poor unfortunate beggar.

 I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
Affliction till it do cry out itself
'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
I took it for a man; often 'twould say
'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.

  The trick of that voice I do well remember:
Is't not the king?

  O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?

      You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
To die before you please!

  Hearty thanks:
The bounty and the benison of heaven
To boot, and boot!
Enter OSWALD.
 Now let thy friendly hand
Put strength enough to't.   [Edgar interposes.
 What, is he dead?

 The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
Of my huge sorrows!   Better I were distract:
So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
And woes by wrong imaginations lose
The knowledge of themselves.

 Grace go with you, sir!
                                    [Exit Edgar.
Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR.
 No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.

 And that's true too. [Exeunt.
"
103,lr-13,EDGAR,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-13,"          I am sure on't, not a word.

 I heard myself proclaim'd;
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
I will preserve myself: and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury, in contempt of man,
Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
Blanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots;
And with presented nakedness out-face
The winds and persecutions of the sky.
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
And with this horrible object, from low farms,
Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.
                                           [Exit.  Away! the foul fiend follows me!
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

  Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!

      S. Withold footed thrice the old;
   He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;
             Bid her alight,
             And her troth plight,
   And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!

    But mice and rats, and such small deer,
   Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
 Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!

 The prince of darkness is a gentle-
man:  Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.

    Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
 His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
   I smell the blood of a British man.
                                         [Exeunt. Frateretto calls me; and tells me
Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.

  Look, where he stands and glares!
Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
    Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--

  Let us deal justly.
   Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
    Thy sheep be in the corn;
   And for, one blast of thy minikin mouth,
    Thy sheep shall take no harm.
Pur! the cat is gray.

  [Aside] My tears begin to take his part so much,
They'll mar my counterfeiting.

      Be thy mouth or black or white,
     Tooth that poisons if it bite;
     Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,
     Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
     Or bobtail tyke or trundle-tail,
     Tom will make them weep and wail:
     For, with throwing thus my head.
     Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes
and fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy
horn is dry.

 When we our betters see bearing our woes,
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er-skip,
When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
How light and portable my pain seems now,
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
Lurk, lurk.                                 [Exit. Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
The lamentable change is from the best;
The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
Enter GLOUCESTER, led by Old Man.
My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
Life would not yield to age.

 [Aside]O gods!  Who is't can say 'I
am at the worst;?
I am worse than e'er I was.

 [Aside]And worse I may be yet:  the
worst is not
So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'

 [Aside]How should this be?
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!

     Give me thy arm:
Poor Tom shall lead thee.              [Exeunt.
  You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.

 Horrible steep.
Hark, do you hear the sea?

 Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes' anguish.

 You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
But in my garments.

 Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong.

 Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright.

 Now fare you well, good sir.

 Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it.

 Gone, sir: farewell.
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life, when life itself
Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
Ho, you sir! friend!   Hear you, sir! speak!
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
What are you, sir?

 Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
So many fathom down precipitating,
Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.

 From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.

 Give me your arm:
Up: so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.

 This is above all strangeness.
Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
Which parted from you?

 As I stood here below, methought his eyes
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honors
Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.

    I would not take this from report; it is,
And my heart breaks at it.

 O, matter and impertinency mix'd!
Reason in madness!

 Hail, gentle sir.

  Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?

 But, by your favour,
How near's the other army?

 I thank you, sir: that's all.

 I thank you, sir.
                                     [Exit Gent.
 Well pray you, father.

 A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
Am pregnant to good pity.   Give me your hand,
I'll lead you to some biding.

 Chill not let go, zir, without vurther
'casion.

   I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
As badness would desire.

  Sit you down, father; rest you
Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
Their papers, is more lawful.
   [Reads]O undistinguished space of woman's will!
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
And the exchange my brother!   Here, in the sands,
Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
With this ungracious paper strike the sight
Of the death-practised duke: for him 'tis well
That of thy death and business I can tell.

 Give me your hand:
                                 [Drum afar off.
Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.
                                         [Exeunt.
 If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
Hear me one word.

 Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
I can produce a champion that will prove
What is vouched there. If you miscarry,
Your business of the world hath so an end,
And machination ceases. Fortune love you!

 I was forbid it.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
And I'll appear again.

 Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
If I ever I return to you again,
I'll bring you comfort.

 Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
Give me thy hand; come on.

 What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
Their going hence, even as their coming hither:
Ripeness is all: come on.

 Know, my name is lost;
By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope.

  What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?

 Draw thy sword,
That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
My oath, and my profession: I protest,
Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
And, from the extremest upward of thy head
To the descent and dust below thy foot,
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
Thou liest.

 Let's exchange charity.
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to plague us:
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes.

 Worthy prince, I know't.

 By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
The bloody proclamation to escape,
That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
That we the pain of death would hourly die
Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
Burst smilingly.

 This would have seem'd a period
To such as love not sorrow; but another,
To amplify too much, would make much more,
And top extremity.
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
He fasten'd on my neck, and bellow'd out
As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear received: which in recounting
His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
And there I left him tranced.

 Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
Improper for a slave.
Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife.
 What kind of help?

 What means that bloody knife?

 Here comes Kent.

 To who, my lord?   Who hath the office? send
Thy token of reprieve.

 Or image of that horror?

 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

 Very bootless.
Enter a Captain.
 He faints!   My lord, my lord!

 Look up, my lord.

 He is gone, indeed.

"
104,lr-5,EDMUND,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-5,"    Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
My services are bound. Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
Lag of a brother?   Why bastard? wherefore base?
When my dimensions are as well compact,
My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
Got 'tween asleep and wake?   Well, then,
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your hand:
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
Shall top the legitimate.   I grow; I prosper:
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
Enter GLOUCESTER.
                        I do serve you in this business.
                                    [Exit Edgar.
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
My practices ride easy! I see the business.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.
                                            [Exit.     The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
My father hath set guard to take my brother;
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
Brother, a word; descend, brother, I say!
Enter EDGAR.
My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
Intelligence is given where you are hid;
You have now the good advantage of the night:
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
He's coming hither; now, i' the night, i' the haste,
And Regan with him: have you nothing said
Upon his part 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
Advise yourself.

 I hear my father coming: pardon me;
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you:
Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
Fly, brother. Torches, torches!   So, farewell.
                           [Exit Edgar.
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
                              [Wounds his arm.
Of my more fierce endeavor; I have seen drunkards
Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
Stop, stop!   No help?
Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants, with
                     torches.
 Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
To stand auspicious mistress,--

 Look, sir, I bleed.

  Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
But I told him, the revenging gods
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
With his prepared sword, he charges home
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the en-
counter,
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
Full suddenly he fled.

 When I dissuaded him from his intent,
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
If i would stand against thee, would the reposal
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
Make thy words faith'd?   No: what I should deny,--
As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce
My very character,--I'ld turn it all
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice:
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it.'

  'Twas my duty, sir.

 I shall serve you, sir,
Truly, however else.

   This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
Instantly know; and of that letter too:
This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
That which my father loses; no less than all.
The younger rises when the old doth fall.
                                            [Exit.     Yours in the ranks of death.

 Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
Or whether since he is advised by aught
To change the course: he's full of alteration
And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.
             [To a Gentleman, who goes out.
 'Tis to be doubted, madam.

 In honour'd love.

 That thought abuses you,

  Fear me not:
She and the duke her husband!
Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY,
            GONERIL, and Soldiers.
 Sir, you speak nobly.

 I shall attend you presently at your tent.

 The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
By diligent discovery; but your haste
Is now urged on you.

 To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
Each jealous of the other, as the stung
Are of the adder.   Which of them shall I take?
Both? one? or neither?   Neither can be enjoy'd,
If both remain alive: to take the widow
Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
And hardly shall I carry out my side,
Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
His countenance for the battle; which being done,
Let her who would be rid of him devise
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
The battle done, and they within our power,
Shall never see his pardon; for my state
Stands on me to defend, not to debate.                                         [Exit.
 Some officers take them away: good guard,
Until their greater pleasure first be known
That are to censure them.

 Take them away.

 Come hither, captain; hark.
Take thou this note [giving a paper]; go follow them to prison:
One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
Does not become a sword: thy great employment
Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do't,
Or thrive by other means.

 About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so
As I have set it down.

 Sir, I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable king
To some retention and appointed guard;
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
To pluck the common bosom on his side,
And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
My reason all the same; and they are ready
To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
And the best quarrels, in the heat are cursed
By those that feel their sharpness:
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place.

 Nor in thine, lord.

 There's my exchange  [throwing down down a glove]: what in the world he is
That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
My truth and honour firmly.

 A herald, ho, a herald!

  Himself: what say'st thou to him?

 In wisdom I should ask thy name;
But, since thy outside looks so fair and war-like,
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
What safe and nicely I might well delay
By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
Where they shall rest for ever.   Trumpets, speak!
       [Alarums.   They fight. Edmund falls.
 What you have charged me with,
that have I done;
And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
That hast this fortune on me?   If thou'rt noble,
I do forgive thee.

 Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
The wheel is come full circle; I am here.

 This speech of yours hath moved me,
And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
You look as you had something more to say.

 I was contracted to them both: all three
Now marry in an instant.

 Yet Edmund was beloved:
The one the other poison'd for my sake,
And after slew herself.

 I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
Nay, send in time.

 Well thought on: take my sword,
Give it the captain.

 He hath commission from thy wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
To lay the blame upon her own despair,
That she fordid herself.

Speak less than thou knowest,

Ride more than thou goest,
Learn more than thou trowest,
Set less than thou throwest;
Leave thy drink and thy whore,
And keep in-a-door,
And thou shalt have more

  To give away thy land,
Come place him here by me,
  Do thou for him stand:

  For wise men are grown foppish,
 They know not how their wits to wear,
  Their manners are so apish.

 Then they for sudden joy did weep,
   And I for sorrow sung,
 That such a king should play bo-peep,
   And go the fools among.

  The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
   That it had it head bit off by it young.
So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.

I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
When priests are more in word than matter;
When brewers mar their malt with water;
When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
When every case in law is right;
No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
When slanders do not live in tongues;
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
And bawds and whores do churches build;
Then shall the realm of Albion
Come to great confusion:
Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
That going shall be used with feet.
This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

 He's coming, madam; I hear him.

 Well, madam.

       Good dawning to thee, friend: art of
this house?

     Why dost thou use me thus?   I
know thee not.

        I never gave him any:
It pleased the king his master very late
To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
When he, conjunct, and flattering his dis-
pleasure,
Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
And put upon him such a deal of man,
That worthied him, got praises of the king
For him attempting who was self-subdued;
And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
Drew on me here again.

 My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
Are gone with him   towards Dover; where they boast
To have well-armed friends.

 Madam, within; but never man so changed.
I told him of the army that was landed;
He smiled at it: I told him you were coming;
His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
And of the loyal service of his son,
When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
What like, offensive.

 Madam, here comes my lord.

 Madam, I had rather--

  Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
What party I do follow.

 A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh
To raise my fortunes.   Thou old unhappy traitor,
Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out
That must destroy thee.

 Wherefore, bold peasant,
Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
Lest that the infection of his fortune take
Like hold on thee.   Let go his arm.

   Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
And give the letters which thou find'st about me
To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out
Upon the British party: O, untimely death!

The night before there was no purpose in them
Of this remove.

 Made you no more offence but what
you speak of?

  Contending with the fretful element:
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,
Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
And bids what will take all.

 None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
His heart-struck injuries.

 I will talk further with you.

   The Marshal of France, Monsieur
La Far.

 Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
Sought to be king o'er her.

 Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
What guests were in her eyes: which parted thence,
As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
If all could so become it.

 'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
Cried 'Sisters! sisters!   Shame of ladies! sisters!
Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
To deal with grief alone.

  No, since.

 Why, good sir?

 Alack, poor gentleman

  O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,
Your most dear daughter--

 You shall have any thing.

 Good sir,--

  A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
Who redeems nature from the general curse
Which twain have brought her to.

 Sir, speed you: what's your will?

 Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,
Which can distinguish sound.

 Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
Stands on the hourly thought.

 Though that the queen on special cause is here,
Her army is moved on.

 Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his
sleep
We put fresh garments on him.

 Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of
Cornwall was so slain?

   The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
Fare you well, sir.                         [Exit.

No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

Be to content your lord, who hath received you
At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.

     We must do something, and i' the heat.

 By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other,
That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
If you come slack of former services,
You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.

 Put on what weary negligence you please,
You and your fellows; I'ld have it come to question:
It he dislike it, let him to our sister,
Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away!   Now, by my life,
Old fools are babes again; and must be used
With checks as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
Remember what I tell you.

 And let his knights have colder looks among you;
What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.

But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,
I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful
By what youself too late have spoke and done,
That you protect this course, and put it on
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
Might in their working do you that offence,
Which else were shame, that then necessity
Will call discreet proceeding.

 I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
These dispositions, that of late transform you
From what you rightly are.

 This admiration, sir, is much o' the savor
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright:
As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
That this our court, infected with their manners,
Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
For instant remedy: be then desired
By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
A little to disquantity your train;
And the remainder, that shall still depend,
To be such men as may besort your age,
And know themselves and you.

 You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
Make servants of their betters.
Enter ALBANY.
 Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
But let this disposition have that scope
That dotage gives it.
Re-enter LEAR.
  Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!
  [To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.

 This man hath had good counsel:--
a hundred knights!
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!

 Safer than trust too far:
Let me still take away the harms I fear,
Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister:
If she sustain him and his hundred knights,
When I have show'd the unfitness,--
Re-enter OSWALD.
How now, Oswald!
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?

 Take you some company, and away to horse:
Inform her full of my particular fear;
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more.  Get you gone;
And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord,
This milky gentleness and course of yours
Though I condemn not yet under pardon,
You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
Than praised for harmful mildness.

  Why not by the hand, sir?   How have I offended?
All's not offence that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so.

 At your choice, sir.

 Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
From those that she calls servants or from mine?

 Hear me, my lord:
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
To follow in a house where twice so many
Have a command to tend you?

 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,
And must needs taste his folly.

 So am I purposed.
Where is my lord of Gloucester?

  My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

   Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

 Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the way.
Enter OSWALD.
Now, where's your master?

 Then shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
If you dare venture in your own behalf,
A mistress's command.   Wear this; spare speech;                   [Giving a favour.
Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
Conceive, and fare thee well.

 My most dear Gloucester!
                                  [Exit Edmund.
O, the difference of man and man!
To thee a woman's services are due:
My fool usurps my body.

 I have been worth the whistle.

  Milk-liver'd man!
That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs:
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
With plumed helm thy state begins threats;
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
'Alack, why does he so?'

 O vain fool!

 Marry, your manhood now--
Enter a Messenger.
 [Aside]One way I like this well;
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
May all the building in my fancy pluck
Upon my hateful life: another way,
The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.
                                            [Exit.
 [Aside]I had rather lose the battle than that sister
Should loosen him and me.

 Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
For these domestic and particular broils
Are not the question here.

 No.

 [Aside]O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.
As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised.
 Not so hot:
In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
More than in your addition.

  That were the most, if he should husband you.

 Holla, holla!
That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.

 Mean you to enjoy him?

 An interlude!

  This is practice, Gloucester:
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
But cozen'd and beguiled.

 Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
Who can arraign me for't?

 Ask me not what I know. [Exit.
"
115,lr-12,REGAN,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-12," Sir, I am made
Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love;
Only she comes too short: that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys,
Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness' love.

 Prescribe not us our duties.

     If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
Which can pursue the offender.   How dost, my lord?

 What, did my father's godson seek your life?
He whom my father named? your Edgar?
Glou. O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!

 Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father?

 No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
That if they come to sojourn at my house,
I'll not be there,

 Thus out of season, threading dark-
eyed night:
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
Wherein we must have use of your advice:
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
Of differences, which I least thought it fit
To answer from our home; the several mes-
sengers
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
Your needful counsel to our business,
Which craves the instant use.

   Sir, being his knave, I will.

 My sister may receive it much more worse,
To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
                    [Kent is put in the stocks.
Come, my good lord, away.
        [Exeunt all but Gloucester and Kent.
  I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty.

 I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
As clears her from all blame.

 O, sir, you are old;
Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
By some discretion, that discerns your state
Better than yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
That to our sister you do make return;
Say you have wrong'd her, sir.

 Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
Return you to my sister.

 O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
When the rash mood is on.

 Good sir, to the purpose.

 I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
That she would soon be here.
Enter OSWALD.
Is your lady come?

 I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
If, till the expiration of your month,
You will return and sojourn with my sister,
Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
I am now from home, and out of that provision
Which shall be needful to your entertainment.

 Not altogether so:
I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
For your fit welcome.   Give ear, sir, to my sister;
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old, and so--
But she knows what she does.

 I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
Is it not well?   What should you need of more?
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
Speak 'gainst so great a number?   How, in one house,
Should many people, under two commands,
Hold amity?   'Tis hard; almost impossible.

 Why not, my lord?   If then they chanced to slack you,
We could control them. If you will come to me,--
For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
To bring but five and twenty: to no more
Will I give place or notice.

 And in good time you gave it.

  What need one?

 This house is little: the old man and his people
Cannot be well bestow'd.

 For this particular, I'll receive him gladly,
But not one follower.

 O, sir, to wilful men,
The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters.   Shut up your doors:
He is attended with a desperate train;
And what they may incense him to, being apt
To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.

   Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!

 So white, and such a traitor!

  To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king?
Speak.

 And false.

  Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--

  Wherefore to Dover, sir?

  How now, you dog!

 Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
     [Takes a sword, and runs at him behind.
 Out, treacherous villain!
Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
Who is too good to pity thee.

 Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
His way to Dover. [Exit one with Gloucester. How is't, my lord? how look you?

 But are my brother's powers set forth?

 Himself in person there?

  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

  What might import my sister's letter to him?

 'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
To let him live: where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
In pity of his misery, to dispatch
His nighted life; moreover, to descry
The strength o' the enemy.

 Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
The ways are dangerous.

 Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
Let me unseal the letter.

 I know your lady does not love her husband;
I am sure of that: and at her late being here
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund.   I know you are of her bosom.

 I speak in understanding; you are, I know 't:
Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
So, fare you well.
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

 Fare thee well. [Exeunt.
  Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.

 Now sweet lord,
You know the goodness I intend upon you:
Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
Do you not love my sister?

 But have you never found my brother's way
To the forfended place?

 I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.

 I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
Be not familiar with her.

 Why is this reason'd?

 Sister, you'll go with us?

  That's as we list to grace him.
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
Bore the commission of my place and person;
The which immediacy may well stand up,
And call itself your brother.

 In my rights,
By me invested, he compeers the best.

 Jesters do oft prove prophets.

 Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
From a full flowing stomach. General,
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
Witness the world, that I create thee here
My lord and master.

  Sick, O, sick!
 My sickness grows upon me.

116,lr-3,CORDELIA,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-3," What shall Cordelia do? Love, and be silent.

 Then poor Cordelia!
And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
More richer than my tongue.

   Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
According to my bond; nor more nor less.

 Good my lord,
You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
Return those duties back as are right fit,
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
They loved you all? Haply, when I shall wed.
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
To love my father all.

 Ay, good my lord.

  So young, my lord, and true.

 I yet beseech your majesty,--
If for I want that glib and oily art,
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
That hath deprived me of your grace and favor;
But even for want of that for which I am richer,
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking.

 Peace be with Burgundy!
Since that respects of fortune are his love,
I shall not be his wife.

 The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
To your professed bosoms I commit him:
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
I would prefer him to a better place.
So, farewell to you both.

 Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
Well may you prosper!

 Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo- flowers,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
Search every acre in the high-grown field,
And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.] What can man's wisdom
In the restoring his bereaved sense?
He that helps him take all my outward worth.

 All blest secrets,
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
In the good man's distress!   Seek, seek for him;
Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it.
Enter a Messenger.
 'Tis known before; our preparation stands
In expectation of them. O dear father,
It is thy business that I go about;
Therefore great France
My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
But love, dear love and our aged father's right:
Soon may I hear and see him!         [Exeunt.
 O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
To match thy goodness?   My life will be too short,
And every measure fail me.

 Be better suited:
These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
I prithee, put them off.

 Then be't so, my good lord. [To the
     Doctor] How does the king?

 O you kind gods,
Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
Of this child-changed father!

 Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?

 Very well.

 O my dear father!   Restoration hang
Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made!

 Had you not been their father, these white flakes
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
To be opposed against the warring winds?
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
With this thin helm?   Mine enemy's dog,
Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.

  Sir, do you know me?

  Still, still, far wide!

 O, look upon me, sir,
And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
No, sir, you must not kneel.

 And so am I, I am.

 No cause, no cause.

 Will't please your highness walk?

 We are not the first
Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

118,lr-21,Messengers,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-21," O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead;
Slain by his servant, going to put out
The other eye of Gloucester.

 A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
Opposed against the act, bending his sword
To his great master; who, thereat enraged,
Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
But not without that harmful stroke, which since
Hath pluck'd him after.

 Both, both, my lord.
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
'Tis from your sister.

 Come with my lady hither.

 No, my good lord; I met him back again.

 Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;
And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
Might have the freer course.

                        News, madam;
The British powers are marching hitherward.

"
119,alon.,ALONSO,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-alon.,"  Prithee, peace.

  You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
Who is so far from Italy removed
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee?

 No, no, he's gone.

 Prithee, peace.

 So is the dear'st o' the loss.

  What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
Would with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
They are inclined to do so.

 Thank you.   Wondrous heavy.

Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel.
 Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
Wherefore this ghastly looking?

 I heard nothing.

 Heard you this, Gonzalo?

 Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
For my poor son.

 Lead away.

 Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest,
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

 What harmony is this?   My good friends, hark!

 Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?

 I cannot too much muse
Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
Of excellent dumb discourse.

 Not I.

 I will stand to and feed,
Although my last: no matter, since I feel
The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
Stand to and do as we.

Thunder and lightning.Enter ARIEL, like a
harpy, claps his wings upon the table;
and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes.
 O, it is monstrous, monstrous!
Methought. the billows spoke and told me of it;
The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
And with him there lie mudded. [Exit.
 Whether thou be'st he or no,
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
An if this be at all, a most strange story.
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
Be living and be here?

 If thou be'st Prospero,
Give us particulars of thy preservation;
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
My dear son Ferdinand.

 Irreparable is the loss, and patience
Says it is past her cure.

 You the like loss!

 A daughter?
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?

 If this prove
A vision of the Island, one dear son
Shall I twice lose.

 Now all the blessings
Of a glad father compass thee about!
Arise, and say how thou camest here.

 What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
And brought us thus together?

 I am hers:
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
Must ask my child forgiveness!

 I say, Amen, Gonzalo!

 Give me your hands:
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
That doth not wish you joy!

 These are not natural events; they strengthen
From strange to stranger.   Say, how came you hither?

 This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod;
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge.

 Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

 And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
How camest thou in this pickle?

 This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on. [Pointing to Caliban. 
 Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

 I long
To hear the story of your life, which must
Take the ear strangely.

"
120,seb.,SEBASTIAN,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-seb.,"  I'm out of patience.


 Let's take leave of him.
[Exeunt Ant. and Seb.
                        Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
But rather lose her to an African;
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
Who hath cause to wet the grief on 't.

 You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all of us, and the fair soul herself
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your son,
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
Moe widows in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault 's your own.

 Very well.

 Foul weather?

 Or docks, or mallows.

 'Scape being drunk for want of wine.

 Yet he would be king on 't.

 No marrying 'mong his subjects?

 God save his majesty!

   Please you, sir.
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
It is a comforter.

 What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

 Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself disposed to sleep.

 What, art thou waking?

 I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose, to be asleep
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking moving,
And yet so fast asleep.

 Thou dost snore distinctly;
There's meaning in thy snores.

 Well, I am standing water.

 Do so: to ebb
Hereditary sloth instructs me.

 Prithee, say on;
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
Which throes thee much to yield.

 I have no hope
That he's undrown'd.

 He's gone.

 Claribel.

 What stuff is this! how say you?
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
So is she heir of Naples: 'twixt which regions
There is some space.

 Methinks I do.

 I remember
You did supplant your brother Prospero.

 But, for your conscience?

 Thy case, dear friend,
Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
And I the king shall love thee.

 O, but one word.
[They talk apart.]

           Re-enter ARIEL, invisible.
 Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
Like bulls, or rather lions: did 't not wake you?
It struck mine ear most terribly.

   A living drollery. Now I will believe
That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
At this hour reigning there.

 No matter, since
They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
Will 't please you taste of what is here?

 But one fiend at a time,
I'll fight their legions o'er.

 The devil speaks in him.

 A most high miracle!

 Ha, ha!
What things are these, my lord Antonio?
Will money buy 'em?

 He is drunk now: where had he wine?

  Or stole it, rather. [Exeunt Cal., Ste., and Trin.
"
121,pros.,PROSPERO,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-pros.," Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.

 No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
And thy no greater father.

 'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
[Lays down his mantle.
Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
The very virtue of compassion in thee,
I have with such provision in mine art
So safely ordered that there is no soul-
No, not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
For thou must now know farther.

 The hour's now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
Out three years old.

 By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.

 Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
That this lives in thy mind?   What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
How thou camest here thou mayst.

 Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power.

 Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
And princess no worse issued.

 Both, both, my girl:
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
But blessedly holp hither.

 My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state; as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
In dignity, and for the liberal arts
Without a parallel; those being all my study,
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?

 Being once perfected how to grant suits,
How to deny them, who to advance and who
To trash for over-topping, new created
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
And suck'd my verdure out on 't. Thou attend'st not.

 I pray thee, mark me.
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, and dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which, but by being so retired,
O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
Like a good parent, did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
Not only with what my revenue yielded,
But what my power might else exact, like one
Who having into truth, by telling of it,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
To credit his own lie, he did believe
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution,
And executing the outward face of royalty,
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
Dost thou hear?

 To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
The   dukedom   yet   unbow'd--alas,   poor Milan!--
To most ignoble stooping.

 Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
If this might be a brother.

 Now the condition.
This King of Naples, being an enemy
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
Me and thy crying self.

 Hear a little further
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Which now 's upon 's; without the which this story
Were most impertinent.

 Well demanded, wench:
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
A mark so bloody on the business, but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
Instinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
Did us but loving wrong.

 O, a cherubin
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Against what should ensue.

 By Providence divine.
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
Out of his charity, who being then appointed
Master of this design, did give us, with
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.

 Now I arise: [Resumes his mantle.
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
Here in this island we arrived; and here
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
Than other princesses can that have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

 Know thus far forth.
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star, whose influence
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
Will ever after droop.   Here cease more questions:
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
And give it way: I know   thou canst not choose. [Miranda sleeps. 
Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
Approach, my Ariel, come.

Enter ARIEL.
 Hast thou, spirit,
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

 My brave spirit!
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
Would not infect his reason?

 Why, that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?

 But are they, Ariel, safe?

 Of the king's ship
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
And all the rest o' the fleet.

 Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
What is the time o' the day?

 At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously.

 How now? moody?
What is't thou canst demand?

 Before the time be out? no more!

 Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee?

 Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Of the salt deep,
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
To do me business in the veins o' the earth
When it is baked with frost.

 Thou liest, malignant thing!   Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

 Thou hast.   Where was she born? speak; tell me.

 O, was she so? I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
Which thou forget'st.   This damn'd witch Sycorax,
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing, from Argier,
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
They would not take her life. Is not this true?

 This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
And there was left by the sailors.   Thou, my slave,
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthly and abhorr'd commands,
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent ministers
And in her most unmitigable rage,
Into a cloven pine; within which rift
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
A human shape.

 Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
Whom now I keep in service.   Thou best know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
Could not again undo: it was mine art,
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
The pine and let thee out.

 If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

 Do so, and after two days
I will discharge thee.

 Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
And hither come in 't: go, hence with diligence! [Exit Ariel. 
Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well,
Awake!

 Shake it off. Come on;
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
Yields us kind answer.

 But, as 'tis,
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us.   What, ho! slave! Caliban!
Thou earth, thou! speak.

 Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
Come, thou tortoise! when?

    Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph.
Fine apparition!   My quaint Ariel,
Hark in thine ear.

 Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

Enter CALIBAN.
 For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
Than bees that made 'em.

 Thou most lying slave,
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child.

 Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill!     I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
With words that made them   known.   But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in 't which good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined into this rock
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

 Hag-seed, hence!
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou 'rt best,
To answer other business. Shrug'st thou,malice?
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

 So, slave; hence! [Exit Caliban.
 Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND following. 
ARIEL'S song.

 Come unto these yellow sands.
And then take hands: Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist, Foot it featly here and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
Burthen [dispersedly]
. Hark, hark!
Bow-wow.
The watch-dogs bark:
Bow-wow.

 Come unto these yellow sands.
And then take hands: Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist, Foot it featly here and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
Burthen [dispersedly]
. Hark, hark!
Bow-wow.
The watch-dogs bark:
Bow-wow. The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what thou seest yond.

 No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
Was in the wreck; and, but he 's something stain'd
With grief that 's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
And strays about to find 'em.

 It goes on, I see,
As my soul prompts it.   Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
Within two days for this.

 How? the best?
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

 The Duke of Milan
And his more braver daughter could control thee,
If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
They have changed eyes.   Delicate Ariel,
I'll set thee free for this. [To Fer.] A word, good sir;
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.

 Soft, sir! one word more.
[Aside]They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
Make the prize light. [To Fer.] One word more; I charge thee
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy, to win it
From me, the lord on't.

 Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he 's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
Wherein the acorn cradled.   Follow.

 What? I say,
My foot my tutor?   Put thy sword up, traitor;
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward.
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop.

 Hence! hang not on my garments.

 Silence! one word more
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
An advocate for an impostor! hush!
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels.

 Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them.

 It works. [To Fer.] Come on.
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! To Fer.
Follow me.
[To Ari.]Hark what thou else shalt do me.

 Thou shalt be as free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command.

 Come, follow.   Speak not for him.

[Exeunt.
 Poor worm, thou art infected!
This visitation shows it.

 Fair encounter
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
On that which breeds between 'em!

 So glad of this as they I cannot be,
Who are surprised withal: but my rejoicing
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book.
For yet ere supper-time must I perform
Much business appertaining.
[Exit.
 Honest lord,
Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
Are worse than devils.

 Praise in departing.

 Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
And observation strange, my meaner ministers
Their several kinds have done.   My high charms work
And these mine enemies are all knit up
In their distractions; they now are in my power;
And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
And his and mine loved darling. Exit above.
 If I have too austerely punish'd you,
Your compensation makes amends, for I
Have given you here a thrid of mine own life,
Or that for which I live; who once again
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
Were but my trials of thy love, and thou
Hast strangely stood the test: here, afore Heaven,
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
And make it halt behind her.

 Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
Worthily purchased, take my daughter: but
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be minister'd,
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.

 Fairly spoke.
Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
What, Ariel!   my industrious servant, Ariel!
Enter ARIEL.
 Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Did worthily perform; and I must use you
In such another trick.   Go bring the rabble,
O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
Incite them to quick motion; for I must
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
And they expect it from me.

 Ay, with a twink.

 Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
Till thou dost hear me call.

 Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
Or else, good night your vow!

 Well.
Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
Rather than want a spirit: appear, and pertly!
No tongue! all eyes! be silent. [Soft music.
Enter IRIS.
 Spirits, which by mine art
I have from their confines call'd to enact
My present fancies.

 Sweet, now, silence!
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
Or else our spell is marr'd.

 I had forgot that foul conspiracy
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
Against my life: the minute of their plot
Is almost come.   [To the Spirits.] Well done! avoid; no more!

 You do look, my son, in a moved son,
As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
As I foretold you, were all spirits and
Are melted into air, into thin air:
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
If you be pleased, retire into my cell
And there repose; a turn or two I'll walk,
To still my beating mind.

 Come with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel: come.

Enter ARIEL.
 Spirit,
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.

 Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?

 This was well done, my bird.
Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
For stale to catch these thieves.

 A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
And as with age his body uglier grows,
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
Even to roaring.
 Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering
                   apparel, &c.
Come, hang them on this line.

PROSPERO and ARIEL remain, invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet.
  Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
Than pard or cat o' mountain.

 Let them be hunted soundly.   At this hour
Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
Follow, and do me service. [Exeunt.
 Now does my project gather to a head:
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?

 I did say so,
When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
How fares the king and's followers?

 Dost thou   think   so, spirit?

 And mine shall.
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury
Do I take part: the rarer action is
In virtue than in vengeance:   they being penitent,
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
And they shall be themselves.

 Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
With his own bolt; the strong-based promon. tory
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
The pine and cedar: graves at my command
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
By my so potent art. But this rough magic
I here abjure, and, when I have required
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
To work mine end upon their senses that
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
And deeper than did ever plummet sound
I'll drown my book. [Solemn music.
 Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a
frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO: they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had  made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:
A solemn air and the best comforter
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brain?,
Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
For you are spell-stopp'd.
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
And as the morning steals upon the night,
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
My true preserver, and a loyal sir
To him thou follow'st! I will pay thy graces
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
Thou art pinch'd for 't now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
Unnatural though thou art.   Their understanding
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
That yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel,
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
I will discase me, and myself present
As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
Thou shalt ere long be free.

ARIEL sings and helps to attire him.
 Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
Being awake, enforce them to this place,
And presently, I prithee.

 Behold, sir king,
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
For more assurance that a living prince
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
And to thee and thy company I bid
A hearty welcome.

 First, noble friend,
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
Be measured or confined.

 You do yet taste
Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
[Aside to Seb. and Ant.]
But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
And justify you traitors: at this time
I will tell no tales,

 No.
For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
Thou must restore.

 I am woe for 't, sir.

 I rather think
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
And rest myself content.

 As great to me as late; and, supportable
To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
Than you may call to comfort you, for I
Have lost my daughter.

 In this last tempest.   I perceive, these lords
At this encounter do so much admire
That they devour their reason and scarce think
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
Been justled from your senses, know for certain
That I am Prospero and that very duke
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
To be the lord on 't. No more yet of this;
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
Not a relation for a breakfast nor
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
My dukedom since you have given me again,
I will requite you with as good a thing;
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
As much as me my dukedom.

Here Prospero discovers FERDINAND and
MIRANDA playing at chess.
 'Tis new to thee.

 There, sir, stop:
Let us not burthen our remembrance with
A heaviness that's gone.

 My tricksy spirit!

 Bravely, my diligence.   Thou shalt be free.

 Sir, my liege,
Do not infest your mind with beating on
The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
Which to you shall seem probable, of every
These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
And think of each thing well. [Aside to Ari.] Come hither, spirit:
Set Caliban and his companions free;
Untie the spell. [Exit Ariel. How fares my gracious sir?
There are yet missing of your company
Some few odd lads that you remember not,

 Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen
 apparel.
 Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
Then say if they be true.  This mis-shapen knave,
His mother was a witch, and one so strong
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
And deal in her command without her power.
These three have robb'd me; and this demidevil--
For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
To take my life. Two of these fellows you
Must know and own; this thing of darkness I
Acknowledge mine.

 You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?

 He is as disproportioned in his manners
As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
Take with you your companions; as you look
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

 Go to; away!

 Sir, I invite your highness and your train
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
Go quick away; the story of my life
And the particular accidents gone by
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
And thence retire me to my Milan, where
Every third thought shall be my grave.

 I'll deliver all;
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
Your royal fleet far off. [Aside to Ari.]
My Ariel, chick,
That is thy charge: then to the elements
Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near. [Exeunt.   "
122,ant.,ANTONIO,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-ant.,"   We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!


 Let's all sink with the king.

                    And most chirurgeonly.

 Very foul.

 He'ld sow 't with nettle-seed.

  None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

 Long live Gonzalo!

     We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.

 It is the quality o' the climate.

 Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy   Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.

 Do you not hear me speak?

 Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.

 I am more serious than my custom: you
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
Trebles thee o'er.

 I'll teach you how to flow.

 O,
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth.

 Thus, sir:
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded,--
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
As he that sleeps here swims.

 O, out of that 'no hope'
What great hope have you! no hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
That Ferdinand is drown'd?

 Then, tell me,
Who's the next heir of Naples?

 She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
The man i' the moon's too slow--till newborn chins
Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
And by that destiny to perform an act
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
In yours and my discharge.

 A space whose every cubit
Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
Measure us back to Naples?   Keep in Tunis,
And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
For your advancement   Do you understand me?

 And how does your content
Tender your own good fortune?

 True:
And look how well my garments sit upon me;
Much feater than before: my brother's servants
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.

 Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
And melt ere they molest!   Here lies your brother,
No better than the earth he lies upon,
If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
They'll tell the clock to any business that
We say befits the hour.

 Draw together;
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
To fall it on Gonzalo.

 Then let us both be sudden.

 O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions.

 I am right glad that he 's so out of hope.
Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
That you resolved to effect.

 Let it be to-night;
For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
As when they are fresh.


 I'll believe both;
And what does else want credit, come to me,
And I'll be sworn 'tis true; travellers ne'er did lie,
Though fools at home condemn 'em.

 I'll be thy second.

[Exeunt Seb. and Ant.
 Very like; one of them
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.

"
123,fer.,FERDINAND,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-fer.," Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and, sure it waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather.   But 'tis gone,
No, it begins again.
ARIEL sings.Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
 But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:
Burthen.Ding-dong. The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes.   I hear it now above me.

 Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend!   Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?

 My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

 A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples.   He does hear me:
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The king my father wreck'd.

 Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.

 O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
The queen of Naples.

 No, as I am a man,

 No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.

[Draws, and is charmed from moving.
 So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.

 There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
Most busy lest, when I do it.

    Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen.
 O most dear mistress,
The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do.

 No, precious creature;
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonour undergo,
While I sit lazy by.

 No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
What is your name?

 Admired Miranda!
Indeed the top of admiration!   worth
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard and many a time.
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
Have I liked several women; never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature's best!

 I am in my condition
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
I would, not so!--and would no more endure
This wooden slavery than to suffer
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service: there resides,
To make me slave to it; and for your sake
Am I this patient log-man.

 O heaven, O   earth, bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief!   I
Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
Do love, prize, honour you.

 Wherefore weep you?

 My mistress, dearest;
And I thus humble ever.

 Ay, with a heart as willing
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.

 A thousand thousand!

[Exeunt Fer. and Mir. severally.
 I do believe it
Against an oracle.

 As I hope
For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion
Our worser genius can, shall never melt
Mine honour into lust, to take away
The edge of that day's celebration
When I shall think, or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
Or Night kept chain'd below.

 I warrant you, sir;
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Abates the ardour of my liver.

 This is a most majestic vision, and
Harmonious charmingly.   May I be bold
To think these spirits?

 Let me live here ever;
So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
Makes this place Paradise.

[Juno and Ceres whisper, and send
Iris on employment.
 This is strange: your father's in some passion
That works him strongly.

 We wish your peace.

 No, my dear'st love,
I would not for the world.

 Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
I have cursed them without cause. [Kneels.
 Sir, she is mortal;
But by immortal Providence she's mine:
I chose her when I could not ask my father
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan
Of whom so often I have heard renown,
But never saw before; of whom I have
Received a second life; and second father
This lady makes him to me.

"
124,gon.,GONZALO,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-gon.,"     The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them.
For our case is as theirs.


 He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at widest to glut him.

[A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'--
'We split, we split!'--'Farewell my wife and children!'--
'Farewell, brother'--'We split, we split, we split!']
  Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort,

                  My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.

 It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.

 Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

 And were the king on 't, what would I do?

 I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty.
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--

 All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of it own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.

 I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.

         And,--do you mark me, sir?

     Now, good angels
Preserve the king. [They wake.
 What's the matter?

 Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
Or that we quit this place: let's draw our weapons.

 Heavens keep him from these beasts!
For he is, sure, i' the island.

 By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
I needs must rest me.

  If in Naples
I should report this now, would they believe me?
If I should say, I saw such islanders--
For, certes, these are people of the island--
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
Our human generation you shall find
Many, nay, almost any.

 Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
Who would believe that there were mountaineers
Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
Good warrant of.

 I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
In this strange stare?

 All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
Like poison given to work a great time after,
Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
May now provoke them to.

 All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
Out of this fearful country!

 Whether this be
Or be not, I'll not swear.

 I have inly wept
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,
And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
Which brought us hither.

 Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
Should become kings of Naples?   O, rejoice
Beyond a common joy, and set it down
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own.

 Be it so! Amen!

 Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following.
O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
Hast thou no mouth by land?   What is the news?

"
126,fran.,FRANCISCO,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-fran.," Sir, he may live:
I saw him beat the surges under him,
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
He came alive to land.

 They vanish'd strangely.

"
127,cal.,CALIBAN,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-cal.," There's wood enough within.

 As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!

 I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me.   When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in 't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the island.

 O ho, O ho! would 't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

 You taught me language; and my profit on 't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!

 No, pray thee.
[Aside]I must obey: his art is of such power,
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
And make a vassal of him.

 All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' the mire,
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
For every trifle are they set upon me;
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me.
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.

Enter TRINCULO.
Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
Perchance he will not mind me.

        I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.

 I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.

 I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.

 I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
Thou wondrous man.

 I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

  No more dams I'll make for fish; Nor fetch in firing
At requiring;
Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish:
'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
Has a new master: get a new man.
 How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he is not valiant.

        Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.

 What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.

  Beat him enough: after a little time
I'll beat him too.

 Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
Having first seized his books, or with a log
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
First to possess his books; for without them
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
One spirit to command: they all do hate him
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,--
Which, when he has a house, he'll deck withal.
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter; he himself
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
But only Sycorax my dam and she;
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
As great'st does least.

 Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
And bring thee forth brave brood.

 Within this half hour will he be asleep:
Wilt thou destroy him then?

 Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
You taught me but while-ere?

 That 's not the tune.

[Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe.
  Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises.
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open and show riches
Ready to drop upon me, that, when I waked,
I cried to dream again.

  Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.

 Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
All's hush'd as midnight yet.

 Prithee, my king, be quiet.   See'st thou here,
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
For aye thy foot-licker.

  The dropsy drown this fool! what do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
And do the murder first: if he awake,
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
Make us strange stuff.

 I will have none on 't: we shall lose our time,
And all be turned to barnacles, or to apes
With foreheads villanous low,

 O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
How fine my master is! I am afraid
He will chastise me.

 I shall be pinch'd to death.

 Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
And seek for grace.   What a thrice-double ass
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
And worship this dull fool!

We first put out to sea.

 If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep.
And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
Where but even now with strange and several noises
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
And moe diversity of sounds, all horrible,
We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
Even in a dream, were we divided from them
And were brought moping hither.

Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek.
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffer'd
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart.   Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.

 O, woe the day!

 More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.

 You have often
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

 Certainly, sir, I can.

 'Tis far off
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?

 But that I do not.

 Sir, are not you my father?

 O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?

 O, my heart bleeds
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from   my remembrance!   Please you, farther.

 Sir, most heedfully.

 O, good sir, I do.

 Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

 O the heavens!

 I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.

 Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to 't.

 Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?

 Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

 How came we ashore?

 Would I might
But ever see that man!

 Heavens thank you for 't!   And now, I pray you, sir,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?

 The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.

 'Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.

 What is 't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
it carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

 I might call him
A thing divine, for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.

 No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.

 Alack, for mercy!

 Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way

 There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.

 O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle and not fearful.

 Beseech you, father.

 Sir, have pity;
I'll be his surety.

 My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.

 Be of comfort;
My father's of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Which now came from him.

 Alas, now, pray you,
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
He's safe for these three hours.

 If you'll sit down,
I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
I'll carry it to the pile.

 It would become me
As well as it does you: and I should do it
With much more ease; for my good will is to it.
And yours it is against.

 You look wearily.

 Miranda.--O my father,
I have broke your hest to say so!

 I do not know
One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father: how features are abroad
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you,
Nor can imagination form a shape,
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly and my father's precepts
I therein do forget.

 Do you love me?

 I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of.

 At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
What I desire to give, and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
And all the more it seeks to hide itself.
The bigger bulk it shows.   Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence
I am your wife, if you will marry me,
If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
Whether you will or no.

 My husband, then?

 And mine, with my heart in't: and now farewell
Till half an hour hence,

 Never till this day
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd

 We wish your peace.
[Exeunt.
 Sweet lord, you play me false.

 Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
And I would call it fair play.

How beauteous mankind is!   O brave new world,
That has such people in 't!

"
134,ari.,ARIEL,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-ari.," All hail, great master! grave sir, hail!   I come
To answer thy best pleasure; be 't to fly,
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
Ariel and all his quality.

 To every article.
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
I flamed amazement: sometimes I'ld divide,
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
Then meet and join.   Jove's lightnings, the precursors
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
Yea, his dread trident shake.

 Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty,
And all the devils are here.'

 Close by, my master,

 Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
The king's son have I landed by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
His arms in this sad knot.

 Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
I have left asleep: and for the rest o' the fleet
Which I dispersed, they all have met again
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
Bound sadly home for Naples,
Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
And his great person perish.

 Past the mid season.

 Is there more toil?   Since thou dost give me pains,
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised
Which is not yet perform'd me.

 My liberty.

 I prithee,
Remember I have done thee worthy service;
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
To bate me a full year.

 No.

 I do not, sir.

 No, sir.

 Sir, in Argier.

 Ay, sir.

 Yes, Caliban her son.

 I thank thee, master.

 Pardon, master;
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently.

 That's my noble master!
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?

 My lord, it shall be done. [Exit.
 Hark, hark!   I hear
The strain of strutting chanticleer
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.

 Hark! now I hear them,--Dingdong, bell.

 To the syllable.

 My master through his art foresees the danger
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
For else his project dies--to keep them living,

[Sings in Gonzalo's ear.While you here do snoring lie,
Open-eyed conspiracy
His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care,
Shake off slumber, and beware:
Awake, awake! Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son. [Exeunt.
  Thou liest; thou canst not.

  This will I tell my master.

 You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
That hath to instrument this lower world
And what is in 't, the never-surfeited sea
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
Their proper selves.

Alon., Seb. &c. draw their swords.
You fools! I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellowministers
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
And will not be uplifted. But remember--
For that's my business to you--that you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me
Lingering perdition, worse than any death
Can be at once, shall step by step attend
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
And a clear life ensuing.

He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music.
   Enter the Shapes again, and dance, with
   mocks and mows, and carrying out the
   table. 
 What would my potent master? here I am.

 Presently!

 Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
Each one, tripping on his toe,
Will be here with mop and mow.
Do you love me, master? no?

 Well, I conceive. [Exit. 
 Thy thoughts I cleave to.   What's thy pleasure?

 Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
Lest I might anger thee.

 I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
So full of valour that they smote the air
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor;
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears,
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
Tooth'd briers, sharp   furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
Which enter'd   their frail shins: at last I left them
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
O'erstunk their feet.

 I go, I go. [Exit.
  Hark, they roar!

 On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
You said our work should cease.

 Confined together
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
They cannot budge till your release. The king,
His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
And the remainder mourning over them,
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord, Gonzalo;'
His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
That if you now beheld them, your affections
Would become tender.

 Mine would, sir, were I human.

 I'll fetch them, sir. [Exit.
 Where the bee sucks, there suck I:
In a cowslip's bell I lie;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat's back I do fly
After summer merrily.
Merrily, merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough. I drink the air before me, and return
Or ere your pulse twice beat. [Exit.
 Sir, all this service
Have I done since I went.

 Was't well done?

And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,

Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.

 A contract of true love to celebrate;
And some donation freely to estate

Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but in vain;
Mars's hot minion is return'd again;
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
And be a boy right out.

With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
Answer your summons; Juno does command:
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
A contract of true love; be not too late.

Enter certain Nymphs.
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
In country footing.

Enter certain Reapers, properly habited:  they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;
towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts
suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a

Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
I would not change it.

 Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
Being native burghers of this desert city,
Should in their own confines with forked heads

That your poor friends must woo your company?
What, you look merrily!

 What fool is this?

 Thou shalt have one.

 Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.

 Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
That thou with license of free foot hast caught,
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

 Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
That in civility thou seem'st so empty ?

 What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
More than your force move us to gentleness.

 Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.

 True is it that we have seen better days,
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
And therefore sit you down in gentleness
And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be minister'd.

 Go find him out,
And we will nothing waste till you return.

 Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
This wide and universal theatre
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Wherein we play in.

 Welcome. Set down your venerable burden
And let him feed.

 Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
SONG.
 If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
And let me all your fortunes understand.
[Exeunt. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
Can do all this that he hath promised?

 That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.

 I do remember in this shepherd boy
Some lively touches of my daughter's favor.

 I like him very well.

   If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.

 O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.

 Welcome, young man;
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
To one his lands withheld, and to the other
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
First, in this forest let us do those ends
That here were well begun and well begot:
And after, every of this happy number
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
According to the measure of their states.
Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
And fall into our rustic revelry.
Play, music!   And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.

 Stay, Jaques, stay.

 Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
A
s we do trust they'll end, in true delights.

 No more, no more.

 How dost thou, Charles?

 Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?

 I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
The world esteem'd thy father honorable,
But I did find him still mine enemy:
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
Hadst thou descended from another house.
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
I would thou hadst told me of another father.
[Exeunt Duke Fred., train, and Le Beau.
 Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
And get you from our court.

 You, cousin:
Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
So near our public court as twenty miles,
Thou diest for it.

 Thus do all traitors:
If their purgation did consist in words,
They are as innocent as grace itself:
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.

 Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.

 Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
Else had she with her father ranged along.

 She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
Her very silence and her patience
Speak to the people, and they pity her.
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.

 You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
If you outstay the time, upon mine honor,
And in the greatness of my word, you die.
[Exeunt Duke Frederick and Lords.
 Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be: some villains of my court
Are of consent and sufferance in this.

 Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
And let not search and inquisition quail
To bring again these foolish runaways.
                                 [Exeunt. Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
But were I not the better part made mercy,
I should not seek an absent argument
Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;
Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
To seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother's mouth
Of what we think against thee.

 More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
And let my officers of such a nature
Make an extent upon his house and lands:
Do this expediently and turn him going.

SONG.
     Who doth ambition shun
[All together here.
     And loves to live i' the sun,
     Seeking the food he eats
     And pleased with what he gets,
  Come hither, come hither, come hither:
     Here shall he see
     No enemy
  But winter and rough weather.

  Thus it goes:--
     If it do come to pass
     That any man turn ass,
     Leaving his wealth and ease,
     A stubborn will to please,
  Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
     Here shall he see
     Gross fools as he,
  An if he will come to me.

  A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
A motley fool; a miserable world!
As I do live by food, I met a fool;
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
The motley fool thus moral on the time,
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.

 O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
With observation, the which he vents
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.

 It is my only suit;
Provided that you weed your better judgements
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
That I am wise. I must have liberty
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
To blow on whom I please ; for so fools have;
And they that are most galled with my folly,
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
The wise man's folly is anatomized
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
Invest me in my motley; give me leave
To speak my mind, and I will through and through
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
If they will patiently receive my medicine.

 What, for a counter, would I do but good?

 Why, who cries out on pride,
That can therein tax any private party?
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
Till that the weary very means do ebb?
What woman in the city do I name,
When that I say the city-woman bears
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
Who can come in and say that I mean her,
When such a one as she such is her neighbor?
Or what is he of basest function
That says his bravery is not on my cost,
Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
His folly to the mettle of my speech?
There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here ?
Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn.
 Why, I have eat none yet.

 Of what kind should this cock come of?

  All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow.   Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM. 
    Rosalind is your love's name?

 I do not like her name.

 What stature is she of?

     There I shall see mine own figure.

 I would fain see this meeting.

 Proceed, proceed: I'll
give her.

 Will you be married, motley?

  Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.

  I am so; I do love it better than laughing.

 Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.

  Yes, I have gained my experience.

      Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
The duke hath put on a religious life
And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

 To him will I: out of these convertites
There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
[To duke]You to your former honor I bequeath;
Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:
[To Orl.]You to a love that your true faith doth merit:
[To Oil.]You to your land and love and great allies:
[To Sil.]You to a long and well-deserved bed:
[To Touch.]And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:

 Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
High commendation, true applause and love,
Yet such is now the duke's condition
That he misconstrues all that you have done.
The duke is humorous: what he is indeed,
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.

 Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter:
The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
To keep his daughter company; whose loves
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
But I can tell you that of late this duke
Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
Grounded upon no other argument
But that the people praise her for her virtues
And pity her for her good father's sake;
And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
Hereafter, in a better world than this,
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.

  Get you with him, you old dog.

   Call him in. [Exit Dennis.] 'Twill be
a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.
Enter CHARLES.
   Where will the old duke live?

    O that your highness knew my heart in this!
I never loved my brother in my life.

 Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,
Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?

 If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
Then should I know you by description;
Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
Of female favor, and bestows himself
Like a ripe sister: the woman low
And browner than her brother.' Are not you
The owner of the house I did enquire for?

 Orlando doth commend him to you both,
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?

 Some of my shame; if you will know of me
What man I am, and how, and why, and where
This handkercher was stain'd.

 When last the young Orlando parted from you
He left a promise to return again
Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
Lo, what befel! he threw his eye aside,
And mark what object did present itself:
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
And high top bald with dry antiquity,
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
And with indented glides did slip away
Into a bush: under which bush's shade
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
Lay crouching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
The royal disposition of that beast
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
This seen, Orlando did approach the man
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.

 And well he might so do,
For well I know he was unnatural.

 Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
Made him give battle to the lioness,
Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
From miserable slumber I awaked.

 'Twas I; but 'tis not I: I do not shame
To tell you what I was, since my conversion
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.

 By and by.
When from the first to last betwixt us two
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
As how I came into that desert place:--
In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
Committing me unto my brother's love;
Who led me instantly unto his cave,
There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
The lioness had torn some flesh away,
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
To tell this story, that you might excuse
His broken promise, and to give this napkin
Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
                        [Rosalind swoons.
 Many will swoon when they do look on blood.

 Look, he recovers.

    That will I, for I must bear answer back
How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.

  And you, fair sister. [Exit.

I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
In his own conduct, purposely to take
His brother here and put him to the sword:
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
Where meeting with an old religious man,
After some question with him, was converted
Both from his enterprise and from the world,
His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
And all their lands restored to them again
That were with him exiled. This to be true,
I do engage my life.

 He hath.

"
147,orl.,ORLANDO,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-orl.,"   Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
   O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
      I attend them with all respect and duty.

     Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.

  I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
To be adopted heir to Frederick.

 Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.

 What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.

O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Re-enter LE BEAU.
 I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this;
Which of the two was daughter of the duke
That here was at the wrestling?

 I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
[Exit Le Beau. 
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
But heavenly Rosalind!
                                 [Exit. Who's there?

 Why, what's the matter?

 Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?

 What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
A thievish living on the common road?
This I must do, or know not what to do:
Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
I rather will subject me to the malice
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.

 O good old man, how well in thee appears
The constant service of the antique world,
When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
Where none will sweat but for promotion,
And having that, do choke their service up
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
But come thy ways; we'll go along together,
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
We'll light upon some settled low content.

  Forbear, and eat no more.

 Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.

 You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
He dies that touches any of this fruit
Till I and my affairs are answered.

 I almost die for food; and let me have it.

 Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
I thought that all things had been savage here;
And therefore put I on the countenance
Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
That in this desert inaccessible,
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
If ever you have look'd on better days,
If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
If ever sat at any good man's feast,
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.

 Then but forbear your food a little while,
Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
And give it food. There is an old poor man,
Who after me hath many a weary step
Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
I will not touch a bit.

 I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
                            [Exit. 
 I thank you most for him.

 Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;
That every eye which in this forest looks
Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree
The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.

 Did you ever cure any so?

 I would not be cured, youth.

 What's that?

Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
O, what a world is this, when what is comely
Envenoms him that bears it!

 O unhappy youth!
Come not within these doors; within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives:
Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
Yet not the son, I will not call him son
Of him I was about to call his father--
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
To burn the lodging where you use to lie
And you within it: if he fail of that,
He will have other means to cut you off.
I overheard him and his practices.
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

 No matter whither, so you come not here.

 But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
And unregarded age in corners thrown:
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility;
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
I'll do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities.

 Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
Here lived I, but now live here no more.
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
But at fourscore it is too late a week:
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

         Holla, you clown!

 Your betters, sir.

   Then thou art damned.

   Instance, briefly; come, instance.

       For a taste:
   If a hart do lack a hind,
   Let him seek out Rosalind.
   If the cat will after kind,
   So be sure will Rosalind.
   Winter garments must be lined,
   So must slender Rosalind.
   They that reap must sheaf and bind;
   Then to cart with Rosalind.
   Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
   Such a nut is Rosalind.
   He that sweetest rose will find
   Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
 Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.

            I will not take her on gift of any man.

    Come, sweet Audrey:
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
          O sweet Oliver,
          O brave Oliver,
     Leave me not behind thee: but,--
          Wind away,
          Begone, I say,
I will not to wedding with thee.
[Exeunt Jaques, Touchstone and Audrey.
     A ripe age. Is thy name William?

 A fair name. Wast born i' the forest

 'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?

   Give me your hand.   Art thou learned?

151,sir-oli.,SIR OLIVER MARTEXT,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-sir-oli.," Is there none here to give the woman ?

  "
152,cor.,CORIN,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-cor.," That is the way to make her scorn you still.

 I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.

 Into a thousand that I have forgotten.

 Who calls?

 Else are they very wretched.

 And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.

 Fair sir, I pity her
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
But I am shepherd to another man
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
My master is of churlish disposition
And little recks to find the way to heaven
By doing deeds of hospitality:
Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
By reason of his absence, there is nothing
That you will feed on; but what is, come see,
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.

 That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
That little cares for buying any thing.

 Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
Go with me: if you like upon report
The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
I will your very faithful feeder be
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.
                             [Exeunt.   No, truly.

 Nay, I hope.

 For not being at court? Your reason.

   Besides, our hands are hard.

     Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
That was his mistress.

 If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
Between the pale complexion of true love
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
If you will mark it.

 "
153,sil.,SILVIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-sil.," O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!

 No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:
But if thy love were ever like to mine--
As sure I think did never man love so--
How many actions most ridiculous
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?

 O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!
If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
That ever love did make thee run into,
Thou hast not loved:
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
Thou hast not loved:
Or if thou hast not broke from company
Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
Thou hast not loved.
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe! [Exit.
 Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;
Say that you love me not, but say not so
In bitterness. The common executioner,
Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind.
 O dear Phebe,
If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
Then shall you know the wounds invisible
That love's keen arrows make.

 Sweet Phebe,--

 Sweet Phebe, pity me.

 Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
By giving love your sorrow and my grief
Were both extermined.

 I would have you.

 So holy and perfect is my love,
And I in such a poverty of grace,
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
To glean the broken ears after the man
That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.

 Not very well, but I have met him oft:
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
That the old carlot once was master of.

 Phebe, with all my heart.

 My errand is to you, fair youth;
My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
I know not the contents; but, as I guess
By the stern brow and waspish action
Which she did use as she was writing of it,
It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
I am but as a guiltless messenger.

 No, I protest, I know not the contents:
Phebe did write it.

 Sure, it is hers.

 So please you, for I never heard it yet;
Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.

 Call you this railing?

 Call you this chiding?

 It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
And so am I for Phebe.

 It is to be all made of faith and service;
And so am I for Phebe.

 It is to be all made of fantasy,
All made of passion and all made of wishes,
All adoration, duty, and observance,
All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
All purity, all trial, all observance;
And so am I for Phebe.

  I'll not fail, if I live.

 Though to have her and death were both one thing.

"
155,hym.,A person representing Hymen,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-hym.," Then is there mirth in heaven,
When earthly things made even
   Atone together.
Good duke, receive thy daughter:
Hymen from heaven brought her,
   Yea, brought her hither,
That thou mightst join her hand with his
Whose heart within his bosom is.

 Peace, ho! I bar confusion:
'Tis I must make conclusion
   Of these most strange events:
Here's eight that must take hands
To join in Hymen's bands,
   If truth holds true contents.
You and you no cross shall part:
You and you are heart in heart:
You to his love must accord,
Or have a woman to your lord:
You and you are sure together,
As the winter to foul weather.
Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
Feed yourselves with questioning;
That reason wonder may diminish,
How thus we met, and these things finish.

 Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

 With his mouth full of news.

 Then shall we be news-crammed.

 As wit and fortune will.

 Thou losest thy old smell.

 Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.

  Alas!

  Is yonder the man?

      Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!

 O excellent young man!

 My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
And all the world was of my father's mind:
Had I before known this young man his son,
I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
Ere he should thus have ventured.

 Gentleman, [Giving him a chain from her neck.
Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
Shall we go, coz?

 He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
More than your enemies.

 Have with you. Fare you well.
[Exeunt Rosalind and Celia.
 Not one to throw at a dog.

    I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.

   No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

  Me, uncle?

 I do beseech your grace,
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
If with myself I hold intelligence
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your highness.

 Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.

 So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I when your highness banish'd him:
Treason is not inherited, my lord;
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
To think my poverty is treacherous.

 I have more cause.

 That he hath not.

 Why, whither shall we go?

 Alas, what danger will it be to us,
Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.

 Were it not better,
Because that I am more than common tall,
That I did suit me all points like a man?
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
As many other mannish cowards have
That do outface it with their semblances.

 I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be call'd?

 But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
The clownish fool out of your father's court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

 O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!

  Well, this is the forest of Arden.

 Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
Enter CORIN and SILVIUS.
Look you, who comes here; a young man and
an old in solemn talk.

 Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
I have by hard adventure found mine own.

 Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.

 Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
Is much upon my fashion.

 Peace, fool; he's not thy kinsman.

 Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.

 I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
And faints for succor.

 What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

 I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.

    From the east to western Ind,
   No jewel is like Rosalind.
   Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
   Through all the world bears Rosalind.
   All the pictures fairest lined
   Are but black to Rosalind.
   Let no fair be kept in mind
   But the fair of Rosalind.

 Out, fool!

   Peace!
Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.

     Is it a man?

 I prithee, who?

 Nay, but who is it?

      Orlando?

    Proceed.

  O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.

  'Tis he: slink by, and note him.

  I pray you, what is't o'clock?

                    Nay, you must call me Rosalind.
Come, sister, will you go?
                               [Exeunt. Never talk to me; I will weep.

 But have I not cause to weep?

  I' faith, his hair is of a good color.

   Do you think so?

 Not true in love?

   O, come, let us remove:
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
                            [Exeunt. And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
That you insult, exult, and all at once,
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
As, by my faith, I see no more in you
Than without candle may go dark to bed--
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
That can entame my spirits to your worship.
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
You are a thousand times a properer man
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
That makes the world full of ill-favor'd children:
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
And out of you she sees herself more proper
Than any of her lineaments can show her.
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.

  I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
For I am falser than vows made in wine:
Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
And be not proud: though all the world could see,
None could be so abused in sight as he.
Come, to our flock.
                       [Exeunt Rosalind, Celia and Corin.
 They say you are a melancholy fellow.

  Why then, 'tis good to be a post.

        And I am your Rosalind.

          Ay, and twenty such.

 Are you not good?

  You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'

 Ay, but when?

     By my life, she will do as I do.

    Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.

       Patience herself would startle at this letter
And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
This is a letter of your own device.

 Come, come, you are a fool
And turn'd into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand,
A freestone-color'd hand; I verily did think
That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
I say she never did invent this letter;
This is a man's invention and his hand.

 Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style,
A style for challengers; why, she defies me,
Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?

 She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
[Reads. 
     Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
     That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
Can a woman rail thus?

      Why, thy godhead laid apart,
     Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
Did you ever hear such railing?
     Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
     That could do no vengeance to me.
Meaning me a beast.
     If the scorn of your bright eyne
     Have power to raise such love in mine,
     Alack, in me what strange effect
     Would they work in mild aspect!
     Whiles you chid me, I did love;
     How then might your prayers move!
     He that brings this love to thee
     Little knows this love in me:
     And by him seal up thy mind;
     Whether that thy youth and kind
     Will the faithful offer take
     Of me and all that I can make;
     Or else by him my love deny,
     And then I'll study how to die.

  I am: what must we understand by this?

 But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?

 Was't you he rescued?

 But, for the bloody napkin?

 I would I were at home.

  Counterfeit, I assure you.

   God save you, brother.

        I care not if I have: it is my study
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
Look upon him, love him; he worships you.

 And I for no woman.

 And I for no woman.

 And so am I for no woman.

   Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:
You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
You will bestow her on Orlando here?

 And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?

 You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?

 But if you do refuse to marry me,
You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

 You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?

 I have promised to make all this matter even.
Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her,
If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
To make these doubts all even.
[Exeunt Rosalind and Celia.
 To you I give myself, for I am yours.
[To Orl.]To you I give myself, for I am yours.

 I'll have no father, if you be not he:
I'll have no husband, if you be not he:
Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.

157,cel.,CELIA,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-cel.,"         Were you made the messenger?

  By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

 Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?

     Sport! of what color?

  Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

  Or I, I promise thee.

   Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

  And mine, to eke out hers.

 Your heart's desires be with you!

   Were I my father, coz, would I do this?

 Gentle cousin,
Let us go thank him and encourage him:
My father's rough and envious disposition
Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
If you do keep your promises in love
But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
Your mistress shall be happy.

 Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
 Will you go, coz?

   But is all this for your father?

  Hem them away.

 Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

    With his eyes full of anger.
Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords.
 Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

 I did not then entreat to have her stay;
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
I was too young that time to value her;
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
Why so am I; we still have slept together,
Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
Still we went coupled and inseparable.

 Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
I cannot live out of her company.

 O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go ?
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.

 Thou hast not, cousin;
Prithee, be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
Hath banish'd me, his daughter?

 No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
No: let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
Whither to go and what to bear with us;
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.

 To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.

 I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
The like do you: so shalt we pass along
And never stir assailants.

 What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

 Something that hath a reference to my state
No longer Celia, but Aliena.

 He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
And get our jewels and our wealth together,
Devise the fittest time and safest way
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight. Now go we in content
To liberty and not to banishment.
                           [Exeunt.  I pray you, one of you question yond man
If he for gold will give us any food:
I faint almost to death.

 And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
And willingly could waste my time in it.

    Why should this a desert be?
    For it is unpeopled? No:
   Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
    That shall civil sayings show:
   Some, how brief the life of man
    Runs his erring pilgrimage,
   That the stretching of a span
    Buckles in his sum of age;
   Some, of violated vows
    'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
   But upon the fairest boughs,
    Or at every sentence end,
   Will I Rosalinda write,
    Teaching all that read to know
   The quintessence of every sprite
    Heaven would in little show.
   Therefore Heaven Nature charged
    That one body should be fill'd
   With all graces wide-enlarged:
    Nature presently distill'd
   Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
    Cleopatra's majesty,
   Atalanta's better part,
    Sad Lucretia's modesty.
   Thus Rosalind of many parts
    By heavenly synod was devised,
   Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
   To have the touches dearest prized.
Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
And I to live and die her slave.

  Didst thou hear these verses?

   Trow you who hath done this?

   Is it possible?

  So you may put a man in your belly.

 Nay, he hath but a little beard.

  I' faith, coz, 'tis he.

 Orlando.

   Give me audience, good madam.

          Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

     Well, and what of him?

  I cannot say the words.

    And I'll sleep.   [Exeunt.  Alas, poor shepherd!

 West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom:
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
There's none within.

 It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

 I pray you, tell it.

 O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
And he did render him the most unnatural
That lived amongst men.

 Are you his brother?

 Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

 Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!

 There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!

 We'll lead you thither.
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?

 "
158,phe.,PHEBE,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-phe.," I would not be thy executioner:
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
The cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
That can do hurt.

 But till that time
Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
As till that time I shall not pity thee.

 Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.

 For no ill will I bear you.

 Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'

 Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?

 Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.

 Thou hast my love: is not that neighborly?

 Why, that were covetousness.
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
But do not look for further recompense
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

 Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

 Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
But what care I for words? yet words do well
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
There was a pretty redness in his lip,
A little riper and more lusty red
Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
Between the constant red and mingled damask.
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
In parcels as I did, would have gone near
To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
For what had he to do to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
And, now I am remembered, scorn'd at me:
I marvel why I answer'd not again:
But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?

 I'll write it straight;
The matter's in my head and in my heart:
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Go with me, Silvius.   [Exeunt. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
To show the letter that I writ to you.

 Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.

 And I for Ganymede.

 And I for Ganymede.

 And so am I for Ganymede.

  Nor I.

 That will I, should I die the hour after.

 So is the bargain.

 If sight and shape be true,
Why then, my love adieu!

 I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
Enter JAQUES DE BOYS.
"
159,aud.,AUDREY,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-aud.,"    Would you not have me honest?

   Well, the gods give us joy!

   God ye good even, William.

 Do, good William.

 "
160,first-lord.,First Lord,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-first-lord.," Indeed, my lord,
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
Did steal behind him as he lay along
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
Coursed one another down his innocent nose
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
Augmenting it with tears.

 O, yes, into a thousand similes.
First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
And never stays to greet him; 'Ay,' quoth Jaques,
'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
Thus most invectively he pierceth through
The body of the country, city, court,
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
To fright the animals and to kill them up
In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.

 I'll bring him to you straight
                            [Exeunt. I cannot hear of any that did see her.
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
Saw her a-bed, and in the morning early
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.

 My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

 He saves my labor by his own approach.

 Sir, it was I.

"
161,sec.-lord.,Second Lord,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-sec.-lord.," We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
Upon the sobbing deer.

 My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
Your daughter and her cousin much commend
The parts and graces of the wrestler
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
And she believes, wherever they are gone,
That youth is surely in their company.

"
162,for.,Forester,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-for.," Yes, sir.

 What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
His leather skin and horns to wear.
     Then sing him home;
[The rest shall bear this burden. 
Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
It was a crest ere thou wast born:
     Thy father's father wore it,
     Any thy father bore it:
The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
                   [Exeunt."
163,first-page,First Page,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-first-page," Well met, honest gentleman.

  "
164,sec.-page,Second Page,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-sec.-page," We are for you: sit i' the middle.

 It was a lover and his lass,
  With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
That o'er the green corn-field did pass
  In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:
Sweet lovers love the spring.
Between the acres of the rye,
  With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
These pretty country folks would lie,
  In spring time, &c.
This carol they began that hour,
  With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
How that a life was but a flower
  In spring time, &c.
And therefore take the present time,
  With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;
For love is crowned with the prime
  In spring time, &c.

"
165,k.-edw.,KING EDWARD the Fourth,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-k.-edw.," Why, so: now I have done a good day's work:
You peers, continue this united league:
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.

 Take heed you dally not before your king;
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
Either of you to be the other's end.

 Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
You have been factious one against the other.
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

 Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.

 Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
And make me happy in your unity.

 A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
To make the perfect period of this peace.

 Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
Brother, we have done deeds of charity;
Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

 Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.

 I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.

 Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.

 Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
And yet his punishment was cruel death.
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised?
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury,
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
Who told me, when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
And I unjustly too, must grant it you:
But for my brother not a man would speak,
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life;
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Oh, poor Clarence!
[Exeunt some with King and Queen.
"
166,prince.,"EDWARD, Prince of Wales",Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-prince.," No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy:
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

 God keep me from false friends! but they were none.

 I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
I thought my mother, and my brother York,
Would long ere this have met us on the way:
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
To tell us whether they will come or no!
Enter LORD HASTINGS.
 Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?

 Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
                      [Exeunt Cardinal and Hastings.
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

 I do not like the Tower, of any place.
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?

 Is it upon record, or else reported
Successively from age to age, he built it?

 But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
Even to the general all-ending day.

 What say you, uncle?

 That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With what his valor did enrich his wit,
His wit set down to make his valor live:
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--

 An if I live until I be a man,
I'll win our ancient right in France again,
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

 Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?

 Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
Too late he died that might have kept that title,
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

 A beggar, brother?

 My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.

 My lord protector needs will have it so.

 I fear no uncles dead.

 An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart.
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
[A Sennet. Exeunt all but Gloucester,Buckingham and Catesby.
"
167,york.,RICHARD,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-york.," Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.

 Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester,
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.

 Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.

 Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old:
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.

 Grandam, his nurse.

 If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.

 Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.

 I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth:
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.

 And therefore is he idle?

 Then he is more beholding to you than I.

 I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

 Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.

 A greater gift!   O, that's the sword to it.

 O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.

 I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

 I would, that I might thank you as you call me.

 Little.

 You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
Because that I am little, like an ape,
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.

 What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?

 I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

 Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
My grandam told me he was murder'd there.

"
168,clar.,GEORGE,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-clar.," His majesty,
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

 Because my name is George.

 Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be;
And, for my name of George begins with G,
It follows in his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
Have moved his highness to commit me now.

 By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?

 We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

 I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

 I must perforce. Farewell.
[Exeunt Clarence, Brakenbury, and Guard.
 O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!

 Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.

 Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

 O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I trembling awaked, and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made the dream.

 O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

 Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.

 In God's name, what art thou?

 But not, as I am, royal.

 Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

 How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Who sent you hither?   Wherefore do you come?

 To murder me?

 You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

 I shall be reconciled to him again.

 Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent?   What is my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands on me:
The deed you undertake is damnable.

 Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.

 Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake:
Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me for this;
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be revenged for this deed,
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly:
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.

 My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

 Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

 O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him from me.

 Tell him, when that our princely father York
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.

 O, do not slander him, for he is kind.

 It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would labor my delivery.

 Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.

 Relent, and save your souls.

 Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
As you would beg, were you in my distress:
A begging prince what beggar pities not?

"
169,glou._k.-rich.,RICHARD,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-glou._k.-rich.," Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments:
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks.
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, which says that G
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here Clarence comes.
Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY.
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
That waits upon your grace?

 Upon what cause?

 Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?

 Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

 Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
If we will keep in favor with the king,
To be her men and wear her livery:
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.

 Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
You may partake of any thing we say:
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
And that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks:
How say you, sir? can you deny all this?

 Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.

 Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?

 We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister.
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

 Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
I will deliver you, or else lie for you:
Meantime, have patience.

 Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return,
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here?   the new-deliver'd Hastings?
Enter LORD HASTINGS.
 As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?

 No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
For they that were your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.

 What news abroad?

 Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
And overmuch consumed his royal person:
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
What, is he in his bed?

 Go you before, and I will follow you.
[Exit Hastings.
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to live:
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I: not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent,
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
But yet I run before my horse to market:
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
                                  [Exit. 
 Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

 Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

 Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.

 Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

 Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

 But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

 More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Of these supposed evils, to give me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.

 Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

 By such despair, I should accuse myself.

 Say that I slew them not?

 I did not kill your husband.

 Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.

 I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
Which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.

 I grant ye.

 The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.

 Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
For he was fitter for that place than earth.

 Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

 Your bed-chamber.

 So will it, madam, till I lie with you.

 I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits.
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?

 Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your beauty, which did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world,
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

 These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
As all the world is cheered by the sun,
So I by that; it is my day, my life.

 Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.

 It is a quarrel most unnatural.
To be revenged on him that loveth you.

 He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
Did it to help thee to a better husband.

 He lives that loves thee better than he could.

 Plantagenet.

 The selfsame name, but one of better nature.

 Here. [She spitteth at him.]
Why dost thou spit at me?

 Never came poison from so sweet a place.

 Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

 I would they were, that I might die at once;
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,
No, when my father York and Edward wept,
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my father's death,
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks,
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing words;
But, now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak.
[She looks scornfully at him. 
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom,
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
[He lays his breast open: she offers at it  with his sword.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
[Here she lets fall the sword.
Take up the sword again, or take up me.

 Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.

 Tush, that was in thy rage:
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.

 'Tis figured in my tongue.

 Then never man was true.

 Say, then, my peace is made.

 But shall I live in hope?

 Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

 Look, how this ring encompasseth thy finger,
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favor at thy gracious hand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.

 That it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,
Grant me this boon.

 Bid me farewell.

 Sirs, take up the corse.

 No, to White-Friars; there attend my coming.
[Exeunt all but Gloucester. 
Was ever woman in this humor woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humor won?
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford:
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this while:
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain some score or two of tailors,
To study fashions to adorn my body:
Since I am crept in favor with myself,
I will maintain it with some little cost.
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass. [Exit. They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
Who are they that complain unto the king,
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
But thus his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

 To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all!   His royal person,--
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

 I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
Since every Jack became a gentleman,
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.

 Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
Myself disgraced, and the nobility
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.

 You may deny that you were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

 She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that:
She may help you to many fair preferments,
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honors on your high deserts.
What may she not?   She may, yea, marry, may she,--

 What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
I wis your grandam had a worser match.

 What! threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.

 Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
To royalise his blood I spilt mine own.

 In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere now, and what you are;
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.

 Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

 To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine:
I am too childish-foolish for this world.

 If I should be!   I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!

 Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?

 Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

 The curse my noble father laid on thee,
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland,--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

 Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

 Margaret.

 Ha!

 I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.

 'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

 Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.

 Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.

 What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

 I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her.

 But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good,
That is too cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains:
God pardon them that are the cause of it!

 So do I ever: [Aside]being well advised
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
Enter CATESBY.
 I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls;
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
Enter two Murderers.
But, soft! here come my executioners.
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?

 Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
[Gives the warrant. 
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

 Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
I like you, lads; about your business straight;
Go, go, dispatch.

 Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!

 A blessed labor, my most sovereign liege:
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
Hold me a foe;
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
By any in this presence, I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity:
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
That all without desert have frown'd on me;
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born to-night:
I thank my God for my humility.

 Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this,
To be so flouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
                           [They all start.
You do him injury to scorn his corse.

 But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
And that a winged Mercury did bear;
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
That came too lag to see him buried.
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
And yet go current from suspicion!
Enter DERBY.
 This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
To comfort Edward with our company.

 Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star;
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing.

 Amen; and make me die a good old man!
That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
I marvel why her grace did leave it out.

 I hope the king made peace with all of us;
And the compact is firm and true in me.

 Then be it so; and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
To give your censures in this weighty business?

 My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet!   My dear cousin,
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
                           [Exeunt.  Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign:
The weary way hath made you melancholy.

 Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts:
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!

 My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
Enter the Lord Mayor, and his train.
 Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I may counsel you, some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and recreation.

 So wise so young, they say, do never live long.

 I say, without characters, fame lives long.
[Aside]Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word.

 Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL.
 How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?

 He hath, my lord.

 O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.

 He may command me as my sovereign;
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.

 My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.

 A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.

 Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.

 It is too heavy for your grace to wear.

 What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

 How?

 My lord, will't please you pass along?
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

 Why, what should you fear?

 Nor none that live, I hope,

 No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable:
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.

 Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

 Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

 At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
                         [Exit Catesby. 
 Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.

 And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form.
                              [Exeunt. My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence doth neglect no great designs,
Which by my presence might have been concluded.

 Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.

 My lord of Ely!

 When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden there:
I do beseech you send for some of them.

 Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
[Drawing him aside. 
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
As he will lose his head ere give consent
His master's son, as worshipful he terms it,
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

 I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
Upon my body with their hellish charms?

 Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

 If! thou protector of this damned strumpet,
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'? Thou art a traitor:
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
I will not dine until I see the same.
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
[Exeunt all but Hastings, Ratcliff, and Lovel.

 Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy color,
Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
And then begin again, and stop again,
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?

 He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
Enter the Mayor and CATESBY. 
 Look to the drawbridge there!

 Catesby, o'erlook the walls.

 Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.

 Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head.
 So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts:
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
He lived from all attainder of suspect.

 What, think you we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
But that the extreme peril of the case,
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
Enforced us to this execution?

 Yet had not we determined he should die,
Until your lordship came to see his death;
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens, who haply may
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.

 And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
To avoid the carping censures of the world.

 Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
Only for saying he would make his son
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
Which, by the sign thereof, was termed so.
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury,
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
Without control, listed to make his prey.
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
Tell them, when that my mother went with child
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
My princely father then had wars in France;
And, by just computation of the time,
Found that the issue was not his begot;
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.

 If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's castle;
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.

 Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
[To Cate.] Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
                    [Exeunt all but Gloucester.
Now will I in, to take some privy order,
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
And to give notice, that no manner of person
At any time have recourse unto the princes.
                                   [Exit. How now, my lord, what say the citizens?

 Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

 Ah! and did they so?

 What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?

 Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?

 I go; and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself,
No doubt we'll bring it to a happy issue.

 My lord, there needs no such apology:
I rather do beseech you pardon me,
Who, earnest in the service of my God,
Neglect the visitation of my friends.
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

 I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

 Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

 I know not whether to depart in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof,
Best fitteth my degree or your condition:
If not to answer, you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
So season'd with your faithful love to me,
Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
First, if all obstacles were cut away,
And that my path were even to the crown,
As my ripe revenue and due by birth;
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
So mighty and so many my defects,
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
And in the vapor of my glory smother'd.
But, God be thanked, there's no need of me,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
Will well become the seat of majesty,
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
Which God defend that I should wring from him!

 Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
I am unfit for state and majesty:
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
I cannot nor I will not yield to you,

 O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
[Exit Buckingham   with the Citizens,
 Would you enforce me to a world of care?
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
But penetrable to your kind entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
I must have patience to endure the load:
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
For God he knows, and you may partly see,
How far I am from the desire thereof,

 In saying so, you shall but say the truth.

 Even when you please, since you will have it so.

 Come, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.
                             [Exeunt. 
 Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham!

 Give me thy hand.   [Here he ascendeth his throne.]
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
But shall we wear these honors for a day?
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?

 O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
To try if thou be current gold indeed:
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.

 Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king.

 Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.

 O bitter consequence,
That Edward still should live!   'True, noble prince!'
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.

 Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?

 I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys: none are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes:
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!

 Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?

 What is his name?

 I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
[Exit Page. 
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
No more shall be the neighbor to my counsel:
Hath he so long held out with me untired,
And stops he now for breath?
Enter STANLEY.
How now! what news with you?

 Catesby!

 Rumor it abroad
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
I will take order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
About it; for it stands me much upon,
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
[Exit Catesby. 
I must be married to my brother's daughter,
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
Uncertain way of gain!   But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Re-enter Page, with TYRREL.
Is thy name Tyrrel?

 Art thou, indeed?

 Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

 Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

 Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel:
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
[Whispers.
There is no more but so: say it is done,
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.

 Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

 Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.

 Stanley, he is your wife's son: well, look to it.

 Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.

 As I remember, Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--

 How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?

 Richmond!   When last I was at Exeter,
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
Because a bard of Ireland told me once,
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.

 Ay, what's o'clock?

 Well, but what's o'clock?

 Well, let it strike.

 Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein to-day.

 Tut, tut.
Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
[Exeunt all but Buckingham.
 Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

 But didst thou see them dead?

 And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

 Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
And be inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till soon.
[Exit Tyrrel.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
Enter CATESBY.
 Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

 Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary:
Then fiery expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
                             [Exeunt.  Who intercepts my expedition?

 A flourish, trumpets!   strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's anointed: strike, I say!
[Flourish. Alarums.
Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus will I drown your exclamations.

 Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

 Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.

 Do then; but I'll not hear.

 And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.

 And came I not at last to comfort you?

 Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
Strike up the drum.

 You speak too bitterly.

 So.

 Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.

 You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

 Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.

 Her life is only safest in her birth.

 Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.

 All unavoided is the doom of destiny.

 You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.

 Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
As I intend more good to you and yours
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!

 The advancement of your children, gentle lady.

 No, to the dignity and height of honor,
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.

 Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.

 Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.

 What do you think?

 Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
And mean to make her queen of England.

 Even he that makes her queen: who should be else?

 I, even I: what think you of it, madam?

 That would I learn of you,
As one that are best acquainted with her humor.

 Madam, with all my heart.

 Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
To win your daughter.

 Say that I did all this for love of her.

 Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
To make amends, I'll give it to your daughter.
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter:
A grandam's name is little less in love
Than is the doting title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below,
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
Your children were vexation to your youth,
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
The loss you have is but a son being king,
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
I cannot make you what amends I would,
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
To high promotions and great dignity:
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
Again shall you be mother to a king,
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repair'd with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl,
Advantaging their loan with interest
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys:
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
To whom I will retail my conquest won.
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.

 Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

 Say that the king, which may command, entreats.

 Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.

 Say, I will love her everlastingly.

 Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.

 So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

 Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.

 Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

 Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.

 Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.

 Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.

 Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--

 I swear--

 Now, by the world--

 My father's death--

 Then, by myself--

 Why then, by God--

 The time to come.

 As I intend to prosper and repent,
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
In her consists my happiness and thine;
Without her, follows to this land and me,
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
It cannot be avoided but by this;
It will not be avoided but by this.
Therefore, good mother,--I must call you so--
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
Urge the necessity and state of times,
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.

 Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.

 Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.

 But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

 And be a happy mother by the deed.

 Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
[Exit Queen Elizabeth. 
Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following.
How now! what news?

 Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?

 Fly to the duke: [To Ratcliff]
Post thou to Salisbury:
When thou comest thither,--[To Catesby]
Dull, unmindful villain,
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?

 O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
The greatest strength and power he can make,
And meet me presently at Salisbury.

 Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?

 My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
Enter LORD STANLEY.
How now, what news with you?

 Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
Once more, what news?

 There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?

 Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?

 Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?

 Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.

 Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore,
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?

 Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?

 Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
I will not trust you, sir.

 Well,
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm,
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

 Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death? [He striketh him. 
Take that, until thou bring me better news.

 I cry thee mercy:
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
Reward to him that brings the traitor in?

 March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
If not to fight with foreign enemies,
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
Re-enter CATESBY.
 Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
A royal battle might be won and lost:
Some one take order Buckingham be brought
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
[Flourish. Exeunt Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?

 My Lord of Norfolk,--

 Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?

 Up with my tent there! here will I lie to-night;
But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the foe?

 Why, our battalion trebles that account:
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
Which they upon the adverse party want.
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
Let us survey the vantage of the field;
Call for some men of sound direction:
Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
[Exeunt.
Enter, on the other side of the field, RICHMOND, SIR WILLIAM BRANDON, OXFORD, and others, Some of the Soldiers pitch Richmond's tent.
 What is't o'clock?

 I will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armor laid into my tent?

 Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

 Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.

 Catesby!

 Send out a pursuivant at arms
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
[Exit Catesby.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!

 Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?

 So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
I have not that alacrity of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

 Bid my guard watch; leave me.
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
[Exeunt Ratcliff and the other Attendants.
Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent, Lords and others attending.
 Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear? myself? there's none else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am:
Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why:
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? for any good
That I myself have done unto myself?
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a villain: yet I lie, I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;
Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree;
All several sins, all used in each degree,
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself?
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
Came to my tent; and every one did threat
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
Enter RATCLIFF.
 'Zounds! who is there?

 O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?

 O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--

 By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see if any mean to shrink from me.
[Exeunt.
Enter the Lords to RICHMOND, sitting in his tent.
 What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

 He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?

 He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
[Clock striketh. 
Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun to-day?

 Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
He should have braved the east an hour ago:
A black day will it be to somebody.
Ratcliff!

 The sun will not be seen to-day;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
More than to Richmond? for the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
Enter NORFOLK.
 Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
And thus my battle shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
Consisting equally of horse and foot;
Our archers shall be placed in the midst:
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will follow
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
This, and Saint George to boot!   What think'st thou, Norfolk?

 'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
A thing devised by the enemy.
Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge:
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell;
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
His oration to his Army.
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
Remember whom you are to cope withal;
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
They would restrain the one, distain the other.
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?
A milk-sop, one that never in his life
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters?[Drum afar off.]
Hark! I hear their drum.
Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yeoman!
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
Enter a Messenger.
What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power

 Off with his son George's head!

 A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
Advance our standards, set upon our foes;
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.
[Exeunt. A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

 Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
[Exeunt."
170,boy.,A young son of Clarence,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-boy.," Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?

 Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'

 Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
The king my uncle is to blame for this:
God will revenge it; whom I will importune
With daily prayers all to that effect.

 Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
Devised impeachments to imprison him:
And when my uncle told me so he wept,
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
Bade me rely on him as on my father,
And he would love me dearly as his child.

 Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?

 I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her ears: RIVERS and DORSET after her.
 Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?

"
171,richm.,"HENRY, Earl of Richmond",Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-richm.," Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Have we march'd on without impediment;
And here receive we from our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn:
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war,

 All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
[Exeunt.  The weary sun hath made a golden set,
And, by the bright track of his fiery car,
Gives signal of a goodly day to-morrow.
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
Give me some ink and paper in my tent:
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
Limit each leader to his several charge,
And part in just proportion our small strength.
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
And by the second hour in the morning
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?

 If without peril it be possible,
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
And give him from me this most needful scroll.

 Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come, gentlemen,
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business:
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
[They withdraw into the tent.
Enter, to his tent, KING RICHARD, NORFOLK, RATCLIFF, CATESBY, and others.
 All comfort that the dark night can afford
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?

 Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
When I should mount with wings of victory:
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
[Exeunt all but Richmond. 
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
That we may praise thee in the victory!
To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
[Sleeps.
Enter the Ghost of PRINCE EDWARD, son to HENRY the Sixth.
 Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

 The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
I promise you, my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it, lords?

 Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
His oration to his soldiers.
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
One that made means to come by what he hath,
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever been God's enemy:
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against your country's foes,
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
If you do free your children from the sword,
Your children's children quit it in your age.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George!   Richmond and victory!
[Exeunt. 
Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, Attendants and Forces.
 God and your arms be praised, victorious friends;
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.

 Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?

 What men of name are slain on either side?

 Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in submission will return to us:
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
We will unite the white rose and the red:
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
The father rashly slaughtered his own son,
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
All this divided York and Lancaster,
Divided in their dire division,
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
The true succeeders of each royal house,
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
And let their heirs, God, if they will be so,
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
That would reduce these bloody days again,
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
Let them not live to taste this land's increase
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
That she may long live here, God say amen!
[Exeunt."
172,card.,CARDINAL BOURCHIER,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-card.," My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the holy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.

 My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?

"
173,rot.,THOMAS ROTHERHAM,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-rot.," Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.

 Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.

 Good madam, be not angry with the child.

 Here comes a messenger.  What news?

 My gracious lady, go;
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
                               [Exeunt.
"
174,ely.,JOHN MORTON,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-ely.," To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.

 Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

 Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.

 My lord?

 Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
[Exit. 
 Where is my lord protector?   I have sent for these strawberries.

"
175,buck.,DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-buck.," Good time of day unto your royal grace!

 Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.

 Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and yours brothers,
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.

 Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

 Have done! for shame, if not for charity.

 Have done, have done.

 Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

 Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

 Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours [to the Queen], but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend,
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
When I am cold in zeal to you or yours.
                               [They embrace.
 And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
Enter GLOUCESTER.
 Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

 We wait upon your grace.   [Exeunt. You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
Now cheer each other in each other's love:
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
We are to reap the harvest of his son.
The broken rancor of your high-swoln hearts,
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.

 Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out;
Which would be so much the more dangerous,
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
And may direct his course as please himself,
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.

 My lord, whoever journeys to the prince,
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
As index to the story we late talk'd of,
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.

 Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.

 And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

 Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently?
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

 You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
Too ceremonious and traditional:
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
And those who have the wit to claim the place:
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
You break no privilege nor charter there.
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.

 He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.

 Upon record, my gracious lord.

 What, my gracious lord?

 Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.

 With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

 Think you, my lord, this little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?

 Well, let them rest.   Come hither, Catesby.
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart:
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
For the instalment of this noble duke
In the seat royal of this famous isle?

 What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?

 Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings,
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
To sit about the coronation.
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
And give us notice of his inclination:
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.

 Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.

 Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

 I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.

 What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:
Your honor hath no shriving work in hand.

 I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay:
I shall return before your lordship thence.

 And supper too, although thou know'st it not.
Come, will you go?

 Are all things fitting for that royal time?

 Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
Who is most inward with the royal duke?

 Who, I, my lord! we know each other's faces,
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
Than I of yours;
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.

 Had not you come upon your cue, my lord,
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.

 Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
[Exit Gloucester, Buckingham following.
 Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
Are at my service, like enforced smiles:
And both are ready in their offices,
At any time, to grace my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby gone?

 Lord mayor,--

 Hark! a drum.

 Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--

 God and our innocency defend and guard us!

 Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
That ever lived.
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
Were't not that, by great preservation,
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
This day had plotted, in the council-house
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

 But since you come too late of our intents,
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
                                [Exit Mayor. 
 Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.

 I go: and towards three or four o'clock
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
                                 [Exit.
 Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.

 I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
And his contract by deputy in France;
The insatiate greediness of his desires,
And his enforcement of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, your father then in France,
And his resemblance, being not like the duke:
Withal I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right idea of your father,
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse:
And when mine oratory grew to an end,
I bid them that did love their country's good
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'

 No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
But, like dumb statuas or breathing stones,
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
His answer was, the people were not wont
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
When he had done, some followers of mine own,
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
And thus I took the vantage of those few,
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
'This general applause and loving shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
And even here brake off, and came away.

 No, by my troth, my lord.

 The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
And be not easily won to our request:
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.

 Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
[Exit Gloucester. 
Enter the Mayor and Citizens. 
Welcome, my lord; I dance attendance here;
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
Enter CATESBY.
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
What says he?

 Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
In deep designs and matters of great moment,
No less importing than our general good,
Are come to have some conference with his grace.

 Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
But on his knees at meditation;
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
But meditating with two deep divines;
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
Happy were England, would this gracious prince
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.

 I fear he will.
Re-enter CATESBY.
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?

 Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
And so once more return and tell his grace.
                    [Exit Catesby.
When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
So sweet is zealous contemplation.
Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returns.
 Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
To stay him from the fall of vanity:
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
True ornaments to know a holy man.
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
Lend favorable ears to our request;
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.

 Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.

 You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!

 Then know, it is your fault that you resign
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
The lineal glory of your royal house,
To the corruption of a blemish'd stock:
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
Which here we waken to our country's good,
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Which to recure, we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land,
Not as protector, steward, substitute,
Or lowly factor for another's gain;
But as successively from blood to blood,
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
For this, consorted with the citizens,
Your very worshipful and loving friends,
And by their vehement instigation,
In this just suit come I to move your grace.

 My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
All circumstances well considered.
You say that Edward is your brother's son:
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
To Bona, sister to the King of France.
These both put by, a poor petitioner,
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
Even in the afternoon of her best days,
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
To base declension and loathed bigamy:
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
More bitterly could I expostulate,
Save that, for reverence to some alive,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
If not to bless us and the land withal,
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing times,
Unto a lineal true-derived course.

 Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.

 If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
Loath to depose the child, your brother's son;
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
Which we have noted in you to your kin,
And egally indeed to all estates,--
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
But we will plant some other in the throne,
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
And in this resolution here we leave you.--
Come, citizens: 'zounds I'll entreat no more,

 Then I salute you with this kingly title:
Long live Richard, England's royal king!

 To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd ?

 To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
And so most joyfully we take our leave.

 My gracious sovereign?

 Still live they and for ever may they last!

 Say on, my loving lord.

 Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.

 True, noble prince.

 Your grace may do your pleasure.

 Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord,
Before I positively speak herein:
I will resolve your grace immediately.
[Exit.
 My lord, I have consider'd in my mind
The late demand that you did sound me in.

 I hear that news, my lord.

 My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
For which your honor and your faith is pawn'd;
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
The which you promised I should possess.

 What says your highness to my just demand?

 My lord!

 My lord, your promise for the earldom,--

 My lord!

 I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
Of what you promised me.

 Upon the stroke of ten.

 Why let it strike?

 Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.

 Is it even so? rewards he my true service
With such deep contempt? made I him king for this?
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
[Exit. Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

 Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
If that your moody discontented souls
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
Even for revenge mock my destruction!
This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?

 Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
I wish'd might fall on me, when I was found
False to his children or his wife's allies;
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false faith of him I trusted most;
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
[Exeunt. "
176,nor.,DUKE OF NORFOLK,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-nor.," Here, most gracious liege.

 We must both give and take, my gracious lord.

 Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

 I go, my lord.

 I warrant you, my lord.
[Exit.
 Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.

 A good direction, warlike sovereign.
This found I on my tent this morning.
[He sheweth him a paper.
 My lord, the enemy is past the marsh:
After the battle let George Stanley die.

Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

 No other harm but loss of such a lord.

 Is it concluded he shall be protector?

 Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?

 To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?

 She may, my lord, for--

 What, marry, may she?

 My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
So should we you, if you should be our king.

 Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.

 Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.

 And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.

 A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
To pray for them that have done scathe to us.

 Madam, we will attend your grace.
                          [Exeunt all but Gloucester.
 By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
And with my hand, I seal my true heart's love.

 And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!

 Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?

 Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him;
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF.
 Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?

 And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Which haply by much company might be urged:
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

 Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

 O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.

 Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God,
To hear her prayers for them, as now for us!
And for my sister and her princely sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

 Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
                                 [Exeunt."

 Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.

 It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.

 This interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be unviolable.

 Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
But his red color hath forsook his cheeks.

 Comfort, dear mother; God is much displeased
That you take with unthankfulness his doing:
In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.

 Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?

 The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
To be your comforter when he is gone.

 Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.

 God keep the prince from all the pack of you!

For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.

 With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
That were the cause of my imprisonment.

 More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.

 No news so bad abroad as this at home;
The king is sickly, weak and melancholy,
And his physicians fear him mightily.

 He is.

 O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!

 False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.

 My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.

 So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!

 So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!

 And so swear I, my lord.
                      [They embrace.
 And so say I.

 On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
The queen your mother, and your brother York,
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
But by his mother was perforce withheld.

 I go, my lord.

 Who knocks at the door?

 What is't o'clock?

 Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?

 And then?

 Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
Bid him not fear the separated councils:
His honor and myself are at the one,
And at the other is my servant Catesby;
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers:
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
Were to incense the boar to follow us
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;
And we will both together to the Tower,
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.

 Good  morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring:
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?

 How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?

 I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?

 Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
Because they have been still mine enemies:
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
God knows I will not do it, to the death.

 But I shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence,
That they who brought me in my master's hate,
I live to look upon their tragedy
I tell thee, Catesby,--

 Ere a fortnight make me elder,
I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.

 O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
With some men else, who think themselves as safe
As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.

 I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
Enter LORD STANLEY.
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?

 My lord,
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
And never in my life, I do protest,
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
Think you, but that I know our state secure,
I would be so triumphant as I am?

 Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.

 Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
                [Exeunt Stanley and Catesby.
How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?

 I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
This day those enemies are put to death,
And I in better state than e'er I was.

 Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
[Throws him his purse. 
 I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
I am in your debt for your last exercise;
Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.

[He whispers in his ear. 
Enter BUCKINGHAM.
 Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
Those men you talk of came into my mind.
What, go you toward the Tower?

 'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.

 I'll wait upon your lordship.
                    [Exeunt. My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
Is, to determine of the coronation.
In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?

 I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
But, for his purpose in the coronation,
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
His gracious pleasure any way therein:
But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
Enter GLOUCESTER.
 I thank your grace.

 His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
There's some conceit or other likes him well,
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
I think there's never a man in Christendom
That can less hide his love or hate than he;
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.

 Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.

 The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
Makes me most forward in this noble presence
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be:
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.

 If they have done this thing, my gracious lord,--

 Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
I now repent I told the pursuivant,
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
And I myself secure in grace and favor.
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!

 O momentary grace of mortal men,
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.

 O bloody Richard! miserable England!
I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
                               [Exeunt."
183,stan.,LORD STANLEY,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-stan.," My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
I do not like these several councils, I.

 The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
But yet, you see, how soon the day o'ercast.
This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt:
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.

 They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
But come, my lord, let us away.
Enter a Pursuivant.
 Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence.
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
[To Anne]Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

 Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
You shall have letters from me to my son
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

 Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.

 My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
Where he abides.
[Stands apart.
 None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.

 Richmond is on the seas.

 I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.

 Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
He makes for England, there to claim the crown,

 Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.

 No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.

 No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.

 They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
Please it your majesty to give me leave,
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
Where and what time your majesty shall please.

 Most mighty sovereign,
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
I never was nor never will be false.

 So deal with him as I prove true to you.

 I do beseech you, either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be accused in true report,
Bear with her weakness, which, I think, proceeds
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.

 But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty.

 A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!

 I will not rise, unless your highness grant.

 The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.

 It is, and wants but nomination.

 We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
For I myself am not so well provided
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY.
 What of his heart perceive you in his face
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?

 I pray God he be not, I say.
Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM.
 Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
That in the sty of this most bloody boar
My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
The fear of that withholds my present aid.
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?

 What men of name resort to him?

 Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
These letters will resolve him of my mind.
Farewell.
[Exeunt. 
 Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

 I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
With best advantage will deceive the time,
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
But on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
Be executed in his father's sight.
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
God gives us leisure for these rites of love!
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!

 Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

 He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.

 Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.

 Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.

 My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
And there they hull, expecting but the aid
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

  Your highness told me I should post before.

 My lord?

 Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.

 It is, my lord.

 My lord!

 Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armor.

 No doubt, my lord.

 Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

 That he was never trained up in arms.

 He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'

 Not I, my lord.

 My lord?

"
188,cates.,SIR WILLIAM CATESBY,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-cates.," Madam, his majesty doth call for you;
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.

"
189,cate.,SIR WILLIAM CATESBY,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-cate.," He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
That he will not be won to aught against him.

 He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

 My good lords both, with all the heed I may.

 You shall, my lord.

 Many good morrows to my noble lord!

 It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
And I believe 'twill never stand upright
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.

 Ay, my good lord.

 Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
Upon his party for the gain thereof:
And thereupon he sends you this good news,
That this same very day your enemies,
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

 God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!

 What, my lord?

 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
When men are unrpepared and look not for it.

 The princes both make high account of you;
[Aside]For they account his head upon the bridge.

 My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
To visit him to-morrow or next day:
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
Divinely bent to meditation;
And in no worldly suit would he be moved,
To draw him from his holy exercise.

 I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
[Exit.
 My lord,
He wonders to what end you have assembled
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

 O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!

 Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.

 The king is angry: see, he bites the lip.

 My lord?

 My lord!

 Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

 Here, my lord.

 First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.

 I go.[Exit
 My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

 It's supper-time, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

 It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.

 My lord?

 Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger:
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD.
 Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.

"
190,tyr.,SIR JAMES TYRREL,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-tyr.," James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

 Prove me, my gracious sovereign.

 Ay, my lord;
But I had rather kill two enemies.

 Let me have open means to come to them,
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.

 'Tis done, my gracious lord.

 Ye shall, my lord.
[Exit.
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM.
 The tyrannous and bloody deed is done,
The most arch act of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
'Lo, thus,' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
'Thus, thus,"" quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
Within their innocent alabaster arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd:
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
The most replenished sweet work of nature,
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
They could not speak; and so I left them both,
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
And here he comes.
Enter KING RICHARD.
All hail, my sovereign liege!

 If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness, be happy then,
For it is done, my lord.

 I did, my lord.

 The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
But how or in what place I do not know.

"
191,blunt.,SIR JAMES BLOUNT,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-blunt.," He hath no friends but who are friends for fear,
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.

 Unless I have mista'en his colors much,
Which well I am assured I have not done,
His regiment lies half a mile at least
South from the mighty power of the king.

 Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!

"
192,herb.,SIR WALTER HERBERT,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-herb.," I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.

"
193,brak.,SIR ROBERT BRAKENBURY,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-brak.," I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of what degree soever, with his brother.

 With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.

 What one, my lord?

 I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.

 Why looks your grace so heavily to-day?

 What was your dream?   I long to hear you tell it.

 Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?

 Awaked you not with this sore agony?

 No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
I promise you, I am afraid to hear you tell it.

 I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
[Clarence sleeps. 
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
Princes have but their titles for their glories,
An outward honor for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imagination,
They often feel a world of restless cares:
So that, betwixt their titles and low names,
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
Enter the two Murderers.
 In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?

 Yea, are you so brief?

 I am in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
I'll to the king; and signify to him
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.

 Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
I may not suffer you to visit them;
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.

 I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.

 No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
                                 [Exit.
Enter LORD STANLEY.
"
194,chris.,CHRISTOPHER URSWICK,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-chris.," At Pembroke, or at Ha'rford-west, in Wales.

 Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
And many more of noble fame and worth:
And towards London they do bend their course,
If by the way they be not fought withal.

"
195,priest.,Another priest,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-priest.," Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honor.

"
196,gent.,Gentleman,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-gent.," My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.

 Towards Chertsey, noble lord?

"
197,may.,Lord Mayor of London.,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-may.," God bless your grace with health and happy days!

 What, had he so?

 Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
I never look'd for better at his hands,
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.

 But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
As well as I had seen and heard him speak:
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
With all your just proceedings in this cause.

 Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!

 See, where he stands between two clergymen!

 Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.

 God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.

"
198,sher.,Sheriff of Wiltshire.,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-sher.," No, my good lord: therefore be patient.

 It is, my lord.

"
199,q.-eliz.,ELIZABETH,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-q.-eliz.," If he were dead, what would betide of me?

 The loss of such a lord includes all harm.

 Oh, he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

 It is determined, not concluded yet:
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY.
 The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby,
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

 What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

 God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

 Would all were well! but that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest.
Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET.
 Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
The king, of his own royal disposition,
And not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Which in your outward actions shows itself
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.

 Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends':
God grant we never may have need of you!

 By Him that raised me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

 My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with this condition,
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind.
Small joy have I in being England's queen.

 As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
As little joy may you suppose in me,
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

 So just is God, to right the innocent.

 Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

 I never did her any, to my knowledge.

 Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?

 Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

 A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

 All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!

 Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
I'll join with black despair against my soul,
And to myself become an enemy.

 To make an act of tragic violence:
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.

 Give me no help in lamentation;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints:
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!

 What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone,

 Was never widow had so dear a loss!

 But I hear, no; they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

 A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.

 Pitchers have ears.
Enter a Messenger.
 How fares the prince?

 For what offence?

 Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
I see, as in a map, the end of all.

 Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.

 You have no cause.

 As much to you, good sister! Whither away?

 Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
Enter BRAKENBURY.
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?

 The king! why, who's that?

 The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?

 O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
With this dead-killing news!

 O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell:
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughterhouse,
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

 Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory;
To feed my humor, wish thyself no harm.

 Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.

 Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!

 Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, these tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
For tender princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
                             [Exeunt. Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your mother's lamentation!

 Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

 O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
[Sitting down by her.
 O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

 O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

 My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

 Windy attorneys to their client woes,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Poor breathing orators of miseries!
Let them have scope: though what they do impart
Help not at all, yet do they ease the heart.

 Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
Where should be graven, if that right were right,
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?

 Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

 Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me; I say amen to all.

 I have no more sons of the royal blood
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
And therefore level not to hit their lives.

 And must she die for this? O, let her live,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

 To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

 And only in that safety died her brothers.

 No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.

 True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.

 Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

 What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
To be discovered, that can do me good?

 Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?

 Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor,
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?

 Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

 My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.

 That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.

 Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

 What, thou?

 How canst thou woo her?

 And wilt thou learn of me?

 Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
Therefore present to her,--as sometime Margaret
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body.
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
If this inducement force her not to love,
Send her a story of thy noble acts;
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

 There is no other way;
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
And not be Richard that hath done all this.

 Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.

 What were I best to say? her father's brother
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
Under what title shall I woo for thee,
That God, the law, my honor and her love,
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?

 Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.

 That at her hands which the king's King forbids.

 To wail the title, as her mother doth.

 But how long shall that title 'ever' last?

 But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?

 So long as hell and Richard likes of it.

 But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.

 An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

 Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.

 O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

 Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break.

 Profaned, dishonor'd, and the third usurp'd.

 By nothing; for this is no oath:
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honor;
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
If something thou wilt swear to be believed,
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.

 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

 Thy life hath that dishonor'd.

 Thyself thyself misusest.

 God's wrong is most of all.
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The unity the king thy brother made
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
Had graced the tender temples of my child,
And both the princes had been breathing here,
Which now, two tender playfellows for dust,
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
What canst thou swear by now?

 That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
The children live, whose parents thou hast slaughter'd,
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.

 Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

 Shall I forget myself to be myself?

 But thou didst kill my children.

 Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

 I go. Write to me very shortly,
And you shall understand from me her mind.

"
200,q.-mar.,MARGARET,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-q.-mar.," And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
Thy honor, state and seat is due to me.

 Out, devil! I remember them too well:
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

 Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.

 A murderous villain, and so still thou art.

 Which God revenge!

 Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world.
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.

 A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.[Advancing.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
Yet that by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
O gentle villain, do not turn away!

 But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
That will I make before I let thee go.

 I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

 What! were you snarling all before I came.
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And see another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers:   God, I pray him,
That none of you may live your natural age,
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!

 And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
The worm of Conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou rag of honor! thou detested--

 Richard!

 I call thee not.

 Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!

 Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse that poisonous bunch-back'd toad.

 Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.

 To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!

 Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Your fire-new stamp of honor is scarce current.
O, that your young nobility could judge
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

 And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!

 Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
My charity is outrage, life my shame;
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!

 O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy hand,
In sign of league and amity with thee:
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.

 I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
Have not to do with him, beware of him;
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
And all their ministers attend on him.

 What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day,
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
                               [Exit.
 So, now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
A dire induction am I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret:   who comes here?
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK.
 Hover about her; say, that right for right
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.

 Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

 When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.

 If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
Give mine the benefit of seniory,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
[Sitting down with them.
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him;

 Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!

 Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward;
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Match not the high perfection of my loss:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
And the beholders of this tragic play,
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
To have him suddenly convey'd away.
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!

 I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation of but what I was;
The flattering index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou joy?
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
For queen, a very caitiff crowned with care;
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
And left thee but a very prey to time;
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
These English woes will make me smile in France.

 Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
Compare dead happiness with living woe;
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
And he that slew them fouler than he is:
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

 Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.

201,duch.,DUCHESS OF YORK,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-duch.," No, boy.

 My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
I do lament the sickness of the king.
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.

 Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess who caused your father's death.

 Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

 Ay, boy.

 What means this scene of rude impatience?

 Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
And lived by looking on his images:
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!

 Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

 What stays had I but they? and they are gone.

 Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentations.

 God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!

 I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

 Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.

 Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
ln him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.

 I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.

 How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.

 I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?

 His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.

 What is thy news then?

 Who hath committed them?

 Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors,
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
Self against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or let me die, to look on death no more!

 I'll go along with you.

 Who meets us here? my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well met.

 I am their father's mother; I will see them.

 O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

 Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!
[To Anne]Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!
[To Queen Eliz.]Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.

 So many miseries have crazed my voice,
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

 Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth.
[Sitting down.
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

 I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.

 O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

 Why should calamity be full of words?

 If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me,
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
Enter KING RICHARD, marching, with drums and trumpets.
 O, she that might have intercepted thee,
By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

 Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

 Art thou my son?

 Then patiently hear my impatience.

 O, let me speak!

 I will be mild and gentle in my speech.

 Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

 No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, bloody, treacherous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfortable hour canst thou name,
That ever graced me in thy company?

 I prithee, hear me speak.

 Hear me a word;
For I shall never speak to thee again.

 Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face again.
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
Than all the complete armor that thon wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
And there the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory.
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
If ever he have wife, let her be made
As miserable by the death of him
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
Enter GLOUCESTER.
 What black magician conjures up this fiend,
To stop devoted charitable deed?

 What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.

 Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
O earth, which this blood drink'st  revenge his death!
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!

 Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

 O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!

 Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
For these known evils, but to give me leave,
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.

 Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

 And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

 Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.

 Why, then he is alive.

 In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.

 Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
Didst thou not kill this king?

 Dost grant me, hedgehog?   then, God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!

 He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

 And thou unfit for any place but hell.

 Some dungeon.

 Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

 I hope so.

 Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.

 If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.

 Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

 I would I were, to be revenged on thee.

 It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.

 His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

 Name him.

 Why, that was he.

 Where is he?

 Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!

 Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.

 Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!

 Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
I will not be the executioner.

 I have already.

 I would I knew thy heart.

 I fear me both are false

 Well, well, put up your sword.

 That shall you know hereafter.

 All men, I hope, live so.

 To take is not to give.

 What is it?

 With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.

 'Tis more than you deserve;
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
Imagine I have said farewell already.
[Exeunt Lady Anne, Tressel, and Berkeley.
 God give your graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day!

 No farther than the Tower: and, as I guess,
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the gentle princes there.

 Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.

 Despiteful tidings!   O unpleasing news!

 And I in all unwillingness will go.
I would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!

 No! why?   When he that is my husband now
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, 'accursed,
For making me, so young, so old a widow!
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
As miserable by the life of thee
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!'
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
For never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

 No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.

When he doth run his course. Antonius!

 Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
The barren, touched in this holy chase,
Shake off their sterile curse.

 Set on; and leave no ceremony out.

Flourish.
 Ha! who calls?

 Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
Cry 'Cæsar!' Speak; Cæsar is turn'd to hear.

 What man is that?

 Set him before me; let me see his face.

 What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.

 He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
Sennet. Exeunt all except Brutus and Cassius.
 Antonius!

 Let me have men about me that are fat;
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.

 Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
He is a great observer and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
As if he mock'd himself and scorned his spirit
That could be moved to smile at any thing
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
Than what I fear; for always I am Cæsar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.

Sennet. Exeunt Cæsar and all his Train, but Casca.
 Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
'Help, ho! they murder Casar!'   Who's within?
Enter a Servant.
 Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
And bring me their opinions of success.

 Cæsar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
The face of Cæsar, they are vanished.

 What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Cæsar shall go forth; for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Cæsar.

 Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come.
Re-enter Servant.
What say the augurers?

 The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
Cæsar should be a beast without a heart,
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
No, Cæsar shall not: danger knows full well
That Cæsar is more dangerous than he:
We are two lions litter'd in one day,
And I the elder and more terrible:
And Cæsar shall go forth.

 Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.
Enter DECIUS.
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.

 And you are come in very happy time,
To bear my greeting to the senators
And tell them that I will not come to-day:
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.

 Shall Cæsar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
Decius, go tell them Cæsar will not come.

 The cause is in my will: I will not come;
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
But for your private satisfaction,
Because I love you, I will let you know:
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
And evils imminent; and on her knee
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.

 And this way have you well expounded it.

 How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.
Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA. 
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.

 Welcome, Publius.
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
Cæsar was ne'er so much your enemy
As that same ague which hath made you lean.
What is 't o'clock?

 I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
Enter ANTONY. 
See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.

 Bid them prepare within:
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
I have an hour's talk in store for you;
Remember that you call on me to-day:
Be near me, that I may remember you.

 Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
And we, like friends, will straightway go together. The ides of March are come.

 What touches us ourself shall be last served;

 What, is the fellow mad?

 What, urge you your petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.

CÆSAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest following. 
 Are we all ready? What is now amiss
That Cæsar and his senate must redress?

 I must prevent thee, Cimber.
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
Into the law of children. Be not fond,
To think that Cæsar bears such rebel blood
That will be thaw'd from the true quality
With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
Low-crooked court'sies and base spanielfawning.
Thy brother by decree is banished:
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
Know, Cæsar doth not wrong, nor without cause
Will he be satisfied.

 What, Brutus!

 I could be well moved, if I were as you:
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
But I am constant as the northern star,
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
They are all fire and every one doth shine,
But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank,
Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
Let me a little show it, even in this;
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
And constant do remain to keep him so.

 Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?

 Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

 Et tu, Brute ! Then fall, Cæsar.

Dies.
"
224,jc-33,Octavius Csar,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-33," Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?

 Prick him down, Antony.

 Or here, or at the Capitol.

Exit Lepidus.
 So you thought him;
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
In our black sentence and proscription.

 You may do your will;
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.

 Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
And bay'd about with many enemies;
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
Millions of mischiefs.
Exeunt.
 Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:
You said the enemy would not come down,
But keep the hills and upper regions;
It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
Answering before we do demand of them.

 Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.

 I do not cross you; but I will do so.

[March. 
Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their
Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others. 
 Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?

 Stir not until the signal.

 Not that we love words better, as you do.

 Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
Look;
I draw a sword against conspirators;
When think you that the sword goes up again?
Never, till Cæsar's three and thirty wounds
Be well avenged; or till another Cæsar
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.

 So I hope;
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.

 Come, Antony, away!
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
If not, when you have stomachs.

Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their army.
 What man is that?

 All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?

 Do so, good Messala.

 According to his virtue let us use him,
With all respect and rites of burial.
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie
Most like a soldier, order'd honorably.
So call the field to rest; and let's away,
To part the glories of this happy day.

Exeunt.
"
225,jc-1,Marcus Antonius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-1," Cæsar, my lord?

 I shall remember:
When Casar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.

 Cæsar?

 Fear him not, Cæsar; he's not dangerous;
He is a noble Roman and well given.

 So to most noble Cæsar.

 O mighty Casar ! dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
As Cæsar's death hour, nor no instrument
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
I shall not find myself so apt to die:
No place will please me so, no mean of death,
As here by Cæsar, and by you cut off,
The choice and master spirits of this age.

 I doubt not of your wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand:
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all,—alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
Either a coward or a flatterer.
That I did love thee, Cæsar, O, 'tis true:
If then thy spirit look upon us now,
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
To see thy Antony making his peace,
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
It would become me better than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
Dost, thou here lie!

 Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
The enemies of Cæsar shall say this;
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

 Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Cæsar.
Friends am I with you all and love you all,
Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
Why and wherein Cæsar was dangerous.

 That's all I seek:
And am moreover suitor that I may
Produce his body to the market-place;
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
Speak in the order of his funeral.

 Be it so;
I do desire no more.

 O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,—
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue—
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
And Cæsar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.
Enter a Servant.
You serve Octavius Cæsar, do you not?

 Cæsar did write for him to come to Rome.

 Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
Began to water. Is thy master coming?

 Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the market-place: there shall I try
In my oration, how the people take
The cruel issue of these bloody men;
According to the which, thou shalt discourse
To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand.

Exeunt with Cæsar's body.
 For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
Goes into the pulpit. 
 You gentle Romans,—

 Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Cæsar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Cæsar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Cæsar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest—
For Brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men—
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral.
He was my friend faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.

 But yesterday the word of Cæsar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men:
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Cæsar;
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
Let but the commons hear this testament—
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read—
And they would go and kiss dead Cæsar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue.

 Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Cæsar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, hearing the will of Cæsar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!

 Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
I fear I wrong the honorable men
Whose daggers have stabb'd Cæsar; I do fear it.

 You will compel me, then, to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corpse of Cæsar,
And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?

 Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.

 If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Cæsar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii:
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Cæsar follow'd it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Cæsar's angel:
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Cæsar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Cæsar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
Which all the while ran blood, great Cæsar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
Our Cæsar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.

 Stay, countrymen.

 Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honorable:
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it: they are wise and honorable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend; and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him:
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Cæsar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Cæsar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
Wherein hath Cæsar thus deserved your loves?
Alas, you know not: I must tell you, then:
You have forgot the will I told you of. Here is the will, and under Cæsar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives,
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.

 Hear me with patience. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
His private arbors and new-planted orchards,
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Cæsar! when comes such another?
First   Cit. Never, never. Come, away, away!
We'll burn his body in the holy place,
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
Take up the body.

 Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
Take thou what course thou wilt!
Enter a Servant.
How now, fellow!

 Where is he?

 And thither will I straight to visit him:
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
And in this mood will give us any thing.

 Belike they had some notice of the people,
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.
Exeunt. 
 These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.

 He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
But, Lepidus, go you to Cæsar's house;
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
How to cut off some charge in legacies.

 This is a slight unmeritable man,
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
The three-fold world divided, he should stand
One of the three to share it?

 Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
And though we lay these honors on this man,
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
To groan and sweat under the business,
Either led or driven, as we point the way;
And having brought our treasure where we will,
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
And graze in commons.

 So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
I do appoint him store of provender:
It is a creature that I teach to fight,
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
On abjects, orts and imitations,
Which, out of use and staled by other men,
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him
But as a property. And now, Octavius,
Listen great things:—Brutus and Cassius
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
Therefore let our alliance be combined,
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd;
And let us presently go sit in council,
How covert matters may be best disclosed,
And open perils surest answered.

 Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
Wherefore they do it: they could be content
To visit other places; and come down
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
But 'tis not so.
Enter a Messenger.
 Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
Upon the left hand of the even field.

 Why do you cross me in this exigent?

 No, Cæsar, we will answer on their charge.
Make forth; the generals would have some words.

 In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
Witness the hole you made in Cæsar's heart,
Crying 'Long live! hail, Cæsar!'

 Not stingless too.

 Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
Hack'd one another in the sides of Cæsar:
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Cæsar's feet;
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
Struck Cæsar on the neck. O you flatterers!

 Old Cassius still!

 Where is he?

 This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
Give him all kindness: I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
How every thing is chanced.
Exeunt.
 This was the noblest Roman of them all:
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Cæsar;
He only, in a general honest thought
And common good to all, made one of them.
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'

"
226,jc-23,M. milius Lepidus,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-23," I do consent—

 Upon condition Publius shall not live,
Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.

 What, shall I find you here?

"
227,jc-11,Cicero,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-11," Good even, Casca: brought you Cæsar home?
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?

 Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?

 Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
But men may construe things after their fashion,
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Come Cæsar to the Capitol to-morrow?

 Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
Is not to walk in.

"
228,jc-39,Publius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-39," Good morrow, Cæsar.

 Sirrah, give place.

"
229,jc-37,Popilius Lena,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-37," I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.

 Fare you well.

Advances to Cæsar.
"
230,jc-4,Marcus Brutus,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-4," A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.

 Not I.

 I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
I'll leave you.

 Cassius,
Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved—
Among which number, Cassius, be you one—
Nor construe any further my neglect,
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Forgets the shows of love to other men.

 No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
But by reflection, by some other things.

 Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?

 What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
Choose Cæsar for their king.

 I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honor in one eye and death i' the other,
And I will look on both indifferently,
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honor more than I fear death.

 Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honors that are heap'd on Cæsar.

 That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
What you would work me to, I have some aim:
How I have thought of this and of these times,
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Be any further moved. What you have said
I will consider; what you have to say
I will with patience hear, and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.

 The games are done and Cæsar is returning.

 I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
The angry spot doth glow on Cæsar's brow,
And all the rest look like a chidden train:
Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol,
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.

 Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
That Cæsar looks so sad.

 I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.

 What was the second noise for?

 Was the crown offered him thrice?

 Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

 'Tis very like: he hath the falling  sickness.

 What said he when he came unto himself?

 And after that, he came, thus sad, away?

 What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.

 And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
I will come home to you; or, if you will,
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.

 What, Lucius, ho!
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
Enter Lucius.
 Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
When it is lighted, come and call me here.

 It must be by his death: and for my part,
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
But for the general. He would be crown'd:
How that might change his nature, there's the question.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
And that craves wary walking. Crown him? —that;—
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
That at his will he may do danger with.
The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Cæsar,
I have not known when his affections sway'd
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
But when he once attains the upmost round.
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend. So Cæsar may.
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
Will bear no color for the thing he is,
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented
Would run to these and these extremities:
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
And kill him in the shell.
Re-enter Lucius.
 Get you to bed again; it is not day.
Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?

 Look in the calendar, and bring me word.

 The exhalations whizzing in the air
Give so much light that I may read by them.

Opens the letter and reads.
'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!
Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
Such instigations have been often dropp'd
Where I have took them up.
'Shall Rome, &c.' Thus must I piece it out:
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
'Speak, strike, redress! 'Am I entreated
To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
If the redress will follow, thou receivest
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
Re-enter Lucius.
 'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
Exit Lucius. 
Since Cassius first did whet me against Cæsar,
I have not slept.
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
And the first motion, all the interim is
Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
The Genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council; and the state of man,
Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
The nature of an insurrection.
Re-enter Lucius.
 Is he alone?

 Do you know them?

 Let 'em enter.
Exit Lucius.
They are the faction. O conspiracy,
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
When evils are most free? O, then by day
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
Hide it in smiles and affability:
For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
To hide thee from prevention.
Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS.
 I have been up this hour, awake all night.
Know I these men that come along with you?

 He is welcome hither.

 He is welcome too.

 They are all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
Betwixt your eyes and night?

 Give me your hands all over, one by one.

 No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,—
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
And every man hence to his idle bed;
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
What need we any spur but our own cause,
To prick us to redress? what other bond
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
And will not palter? and what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged,
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise,
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Is guilty of a several bastardy,
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.

 O, name him not: let us not break with him;
For he will never follow any thing
That other men begin.

 Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
For Antony is but a limb of Cæsar:
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Cæsar;
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
O, that we then could come by Cæsar's spirit,
And not dismember Cæsar! But, alas,
Cæsar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
Our purpose necessary and not envious:
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
For he can do no more than Cæsar's arm
When Cæsar's head is off.

 Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
If he love Cæsar, all that he can do
Is to himself, take thought and die for Cæsar:
And that were much he should; for he is given
To sports, to wildness and much company.

 Peace! count the clock.

 By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?

 Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

 Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
Let not our looks put on our purposes,
But bear it as our Roman actors do,
With untired spirits and formal constancy:
And so good morrow to you every one.

Exeunt all but Brutus.
Boy!   Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
Enter PORTIA.
 Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
It is not for your health thus to commit
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.

 I am not well in health, and that is all.

 Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.

 Kneel not, gentle Portia.

 You are my true and honorable wife,
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart.

 O ye gods,
Render me worthy of this noble wife!

Knocking within.
Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
The secrets of my heart.
All my engagements I will construe to thee,
All the charactery of my sad brows:
Leave me with haste. Exit Portia.
Lucius,  who's that knocks?

Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS.
 Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?

 O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!

 Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

 A piece of work that will make sick men whole.

 That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
To whom it must be done.

 Follow me, then.
Exeunt.
 Cæsar, 'tis strucken eight.

 That every like is not the same, O Cæsar,
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!

Exeunt.
 What said Popilius Lena?

 Look, how he makes to Cæsar; mark him.

 Cassius, be constant:
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
For, look, he smiles, and Cæsar doth not change.

 He is address'd: press near and second him.

 I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Cæsar;
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.

 People and senators, be not affrighted;
Fly not; stand still: ambition's debt is paid.

 Where's Publius?

 Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
There is no harm intended to your person,
Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.

 Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
But we the doers.
Re-enter TREBONIUS.
 Fates, we will know your pleasures:
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
And drawing days out, that men stand upon.

 Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
So are we Cæsar's friends, that have abridged
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
And let us bathe our hands in Cæsar's blood
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'

 How many times shall Cæsar bleed in sport,
That now on Pompey's basis lies along
No worthier than the dust!

 Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.

 Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
I never thought him worse.
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
He shall be satisfied; and, by my honor,
Depart untouch'd.

 I know that we shall have him well to friend.

 But here comes Antony.
Re-enter ANTONY.
Welcome, Mark Antony.

 O Antony, beg not your death of us.
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
As, by our hands and this our present act,
You see we do, yet see you but our hands
And this the bleeding business they have done:
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
And pity to the general wrong of Rome—
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity—
Hath done this deed on Cæsar. For your part,
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.

 Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
And then we will deliver you the cause,
Why I, that did love Cæsar when I struck him,
Have thus proceeded.

 Or else were this a savage spectacle:
Our reasons are so full of good regard
That were you, Antony, the son of Cæsar,
You should be satisfied.

 You shall, Mark Antony.

 By your pardon;
I will myself into the pulpit first,
And show the reason of our Cæsar's death:
What Antony shall speak, I will protest
He speaks by leave and by permission,
And that we are contented Cæsar shall
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

 Mark Antony, here, take you Cæsar's body.
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
But speak all good you can devise of Cæsar,
And say you do't by our permission;
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral: and you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
After my speech is ended.

 Prepare the body then, and follow us.

Exeunt all but Antony.
 Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
Cassius, go you into the other street,
And part the numbers.
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
And public reasons shall be rendered
Of Casar's death.

 Be patient till the last.
  My countrymen,—

 Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
Do grace to Cæsar's corpse, and grace his speech
Tending to Cæsar's glories; which Mark Antony,
By our permission, is allow'd to make.
I do entreat you, not a man depart,
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.

Exit.
 Stand, ho!

 What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?

 He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
In his own change, or by ill officers,
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
I shall be satisfied.

 He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
How he received you, let me be resolved.

 Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
When love begins to sicken and decay,
It useth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
But when they should endure the bloody spur,
They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?

 Hark! he is arrived.

Low march within.
March gently on to meet him.
Enter CASSIUS and his powers.
 Stand, ho! Speak the word along.

 Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?

 Cassius, be content;
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here,
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
And I will give you audience.

 Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.

Exeunt.
 You wronged yourself to write in such a case.

 Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.

 The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head,

 Remember March, the ides of March remember:
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
And not for justice ? What, shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers, shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
And sell the mighty space of our large honors
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.

 Go to; you are not, Cassius.

 I say you are not.

 Away, slight man!

 Hear me, for I will speak.
Must I give way and room   to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?

 All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humor? By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.

 You say you are a better soldier:
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

 If you did, I care not.

 Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.

 No.

 For your life you durst not.

 You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
That they pass by me as the idle wind,
Which I respect not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
For I can raise no money by vile means:
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection: I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions,
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
Dash him to pieces!

 You did.

 I do not, till you practice them on me.

 I do not like your faults.

 A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus.

 Sheathe your dagger:
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
And straight is cold again.

 When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.

 And my heart too.

 What's the matter?

 Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
 Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!

 I'll know his humor, when he knows his time:
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
Companion, hence!

 Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.

 Lucius, a bowl of wine!
Exit Lucius.
 O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

 No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.

 She is dead.

 Impatient of my absence,
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
Have made themselves so strong:—for with her death
That tidings came;—with this she fell distract,
And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.

 Even so.

 Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.

 Come in, Titinius!
Exit Lucius.Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA. 
Welcome, good Messala.
Now sit we close about this taper here,
And call in question our necessities.

 No more, I pray you.
Messala, I have here received letters,
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power,
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.

 With what addition?

 Therein our letters do not well agree;
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.

 No, Messala.

 Nothing, Messala.

 Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?

 Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.

 Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
With meditating that she must die once,
I have the patience to endure it now.

 Well, to our work alive. What do you think
Of marching to Philippi presently?

 Your reason?

 Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
Do stand but in a forced affection;
For they have grudged us contribution:
The enemy, marching along by them,
By them shall make a fuller number up,
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
From which advantage shall we cut him off,
If at Philippi we do face him there,
These people at our back.

 Under your pardon. You must note beside,
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
The enemy increaseth every day;
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.

 The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
And nature must obey necessity;
Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?

 Lucius!

Enter Lucius.
My gown.

Exit Lucius.
Farewell, good Messala:
Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
Good night, and good repose.

 Every thing is well.

 Good night, good brother.

 Farewell, every one.

Exeunt all but Brutus. Re-enter Lucius, with the gown. 
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?

 What, thou speak'st drowsily ?
Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'erwatch'd.
Call Claudius and some other of my men:
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

 I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep
It may be I shall raise you by and by
On business to my brother Cassius.

 I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
I put it in the pocket of my gown.

Var. and Clau. lie down.
 Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?

 It does, my boy:
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

 I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

 It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
I will be good to thee.
Music, and a song.
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.

Enter the Ghost of CÆSAR.
How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thou art.

 Why comest thou?

 Well; then I shall see thee again?

 Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.

Exit Ghost.
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake!
Claudius!

 He thinks he still is at his instrument.
Lucius, awake!

 Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?

 Yes that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?

 Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
To Var.
Fellow thou, awake!

 Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

 Ay: saw you any thing?

 Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
And we will follow.

 They stand, and would have parley.

 Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?

 Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.

 O, yes, and soundless too;
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
And very wisely threat before you sting.

 Cæsar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.

 O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.

 Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.

 Even so, Lucilius.

 Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himself, I know not how,
But I do find it cowardly and vile,
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
The time of life: arming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below.

 No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
He bears too great a mind. But this same day
Must end that work the ides of March begun;
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
If not, why then, this parting was well made.

 Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
The end of this day's business ere it come!
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!

Exeunt.
 Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side.

Loud alarum.
Let them set on at once; for I perceive
But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.

Exeunt.
 Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?

 Titinius' face is upward.

 O Julius Cæsar, thou art mighty yet!
Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails. Low alarums.
 Are yet two Romans living such as these?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
His funerals shall not be in our camp,
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
We shall try fortune in a second fight.
Exeunt.
 Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!

 And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
Exit.
 Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.

 Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
Whispers.
 Peace then! no words.

 Hark thee, Dardanius.
Whispers.
 Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.

 Why, this, Volumnius:
The ghost of Cæsar hath appear'd to me
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
I know my hour is come.

 Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
Our enemies have beat us to the pit:

Low alarums.
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.

 Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
Hath almost ended his life's history:
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
That have but labor'd to attain this hour.

Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'
 Hence! I will follow.

Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius.
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it:
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?

 Farewell, good Strato. Runs on his sword.
Cæsar, now be still:
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.

Dies.
Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, LUCILIUS, and the army.
"
231,jc-9,Cassius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-9," Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Cæsar.

 Will you go see the order of the course?

 I pray you, do.

 Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have:
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.

 Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?

 'Tis just:
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
Except immortal Cæsar, speaking of Brutus
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.

 Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester; if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.

Flourish, and shout.
 Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.

 I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favor.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Cæsar; so were you:
We both have fed as well, and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Cæsar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Cæsar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
I, as Æneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Cæsar. And this man
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body,
If Cæsar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their color fly,
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone.
Shout. Flourish.
 Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Brutus and Cæsar: what should be in that 'Cæsar'?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Cæsar.
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.

 I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.

 As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.

Re-enter CÆSAR and his Train.
 Casca will tell us what the matter is.

 They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?

 Who offered him the crown?

 But, soft, I pray you: what, did Cæsar swound?

 No, Cæsar hath it not; but you and I,
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.

 Did Cicero say any thing?

 To what effect?

 Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?

 Will you dine with me to-morrow?

 Good: I will expect you.

 So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise,
However he puts on this tardy form.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite.

 I will do so: till then, think of the world.

Exit Brutus. 
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
Thy honorable metal may be wrought
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Cæsar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
He should not humor me. I will this night,
In several hands, in at his windows throw,
As if they came from several citizens,
Writings all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
Cæsar's ambition shall be glanced at:
And after this let Cæsar seat him sure;
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

Exit.
 Who's there?

 Casca, by your voice.

 A very pleasing night to honest men.

 Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
Submitting me unto the perilous night,
And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
The breast of heaven, I did present myself
Even in the aim and very flash of it.

 You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
That should be in a Roman you do want,
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
Why old men fool and children calculate,
Why all these things change from their ordinance
Their natures and preformed faculties
To monstrous quality,—why, you shall find
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
Most like this dreadful night,
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol,
A man no mightier than thyself or me
In personal action, yet prodigious grown
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.

 Let it be who it is: for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.

 I know where I will wear this dagger then;
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
But life being weary of these worldly bars,
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides,
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure.
Thunder still.
 And why should Cæsar be a tyrant then?
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Cæsar! But, O grief,
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman; then I know
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
And dangers are to me indifferent.

 There's a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
And I do know, by this, they stay for me
In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
There is no stir or walking in the streets;
And the complexion of the element
In favor's like the work we have in hand,
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

 'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
He is a friend.
Enter CINNA.
Cinna, where haste you so?

 No, it is Casca; one incorporate
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?

 Am I not stay'd for? tell me.

 Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
And look you lay it in the prætor's chair,
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
In at his window; set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?

 That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
Exit Cinna. 
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
Is ours already, and the man entire
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.

 Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited. Let us go,
For it is after midnight; and ere day
We will awake him and be sure of him.

Exeunt.
 I think we are too bold upon your rest:
Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?

 Yes, every man of them, and no man here
But honors you; and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.

 This, Decius Brutus.

 This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.

 Shall I entreat a word?

Brutus and Cassius whisper.
 And let us swear our resolution.

 But what of Cicero?  shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.

 Then leave him out.

 Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Cæsar,
Should outlive Cæsar: we shall find of him
A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
If he improve them, may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
Let Antony and Cæsar fall together.

 Yet I fear him;
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Cæsar—

 The clock hath stricken three.

 But it is doubtful yet,
Whether Cæsar will come forth to-day, or no;
For he is superstitious grown of late,
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
It may be, these apparent prodigies,
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
And the persuasion of his augurers,
May hold him from the Capitol to-day.

 Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.

 The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all re member
What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.

 What enterprise, Popilius?

 He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.

 Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
Cassius or Cæsar never shall turn back,
For I will slay myself.

 Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.

Exeunt Antony and Trebonius.
 Pardon, Cæsar; Cæsar, pardon:
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.

 Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'

 And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.

 Where is Antony?

 Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.

 Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!

 So oft as that shall be,
So often shall the knot of us be call'd
The men that gave their country liberty.

 Ay, every man away:
Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Enter a Servant.
 I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
That fears him much; and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.

 Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
In the disposing of new dignities.

 Mark Antony,—

 I blame you not for praising Cæsar so;
But what compact mean you to have with us?
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?

 Brutus, a word with you.
Aside to Bru.
You know not what you do: do not consent
That Antony speak in his funeral:
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter?

 I know not what may fall; I like it not.

 Stand, ho!

 Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.

 Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
And when you do them—

 Pindarus,
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground.

 That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.

 In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offence should bear his comment.

 I an itching palm!
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were els your last.

 Chastisement!

 Brutus, bay not me;
I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
Older in practice, abler than yourself
To make conditions.

 I am.

 Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.

 Is't possible?

 O ye gods, ye gods   must I endure all this?

 Is it come to this?

 You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
Did I say 'better'?

 When Cæsar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.

 I durst not!

 What, durst not tempt him!

 Do not presume too much upon my love;
I may do that I shall be sorry for.

 I denied you not.

 I did not: he was but a fool that brought
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

 You love me not.

 A friendly eye could never see such faults.

 Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
For Cassius is aweary of the world;
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
And here my naked breast; within, a heart
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
Strike, as thou didst at Cæsar; for, I know,
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

 Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?

 Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.

 O Brutus!

 Have not you love enough to bear with me,
When that rash humor which my mother gave me
Makes me forgetful?

 How now! what's the matter?

 Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!

 Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.

 Away, away, be gone.

Exit Poet.
 And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us.

Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.
 I did not think you could have been so angry.

 Of your philosophy you make no use,
If you give place to accidental evils.

 Ha! Portia!

 How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
O insupportable and touching loss!
Upon what sickness?

 And died so?

 O ye immortal gods!

Re-enter Lucius, with wine and taper.
 My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.

 Portia, art thou gone?

 Cicero one!

 I have as much of this in art as you,
But yet my nature could not bear it so.

 I do not think it good.

 This it is:
'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
Are full of rest, defence, and nimbleness.

 Hear me, good brother.

 Then, with your will, go on;
We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.

 No more. Good night:
Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.

 O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night:
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Let it not, Brutus.

 Good night, my lord.

 Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.

 Antony,
The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
And leave them honeyless.

 Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
This tongue had not offended so to-day,
If Cassius might have ruled.

 A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor,
Join'd with a masker and a reveller!

 Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.

 Messala! Messala,
This is my birth-day; as this very day
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
Be thou my witness that against my will,
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong
And his opinion: now I change my mind,
And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
Who to Philippi here consorted us:
This morning are they fled away and gone;
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal, under which
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.

 I but believe it partly;
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly.

 Now, most noble Brutus,
The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this
The very last time we shall speak together:
What are you then determined to do?

 Then, if we lose this battle,
You are contented to be led in triumph
Thorough the streets of Rome?

 For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.

 O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
This ensign here of mine was turning back;
I slew the coward, and did take it from him.

 This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?

 Titinius, if thou lovest me,
Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
And here again; that I may rest assured
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.

 Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
And tell me what thou notest about the field.

Pindarus ascends the hill.
This day I breathed first: time is come round,
And where I did begin, there shall I end;
My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news? What news? Come down, behold no more.
O coward that I am, to live so long,
To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
PINDARUS descends.
Come hither, sirrah:
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
That ran through Cæsar's bowels, search this bosom.
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
Guide thou the sword. Pindarus stabs him. Cæsar, thou art revenged,
Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
Dies.
"
232,jc-8,Casca,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-8," Peace, ho! Cæsar speaks.

 Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!

 You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?

 Why, you were with him, were you not?

  Why, for that too.

 Why, for that too.

  Why, Antony.

     Ay.

 Ay, he spoke Greek.

  No, I am promised forth.

 Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold
and your dinner worth the eating.

 Do so. Farewell, both.

Exit.
 Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
But never till to-night, never till now,
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
Incenses them to send destruction.

 A common slave—you know him well by sight—
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
Besides—I ha' not since put up my sword—
Against the Capitol I met a lion,
Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
Without annoying me: and there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noon-day upon the market-place;
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
For, I believe, they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon.

 He doth; for he did bid Antonius
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.

 Farewell, Cicero.
Exit Cicero. 
Enter CASSIUS.
 A Roman.

 Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!

 Who ever knew the heavens menace so?

 But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.

 'Tis Casar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?

 Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Cæsar as a king;
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
In every place, save here in Italy.

 So can I:
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity.

 You speak to Casca, and to such a man
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest.

 Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.

 O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
And that which would appear offence in us,
His countenance, like richest alchemy,
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.

 No.

 You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises
Which is a great way growing on the south
Weighing the youthful season of the year.
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
He first presents his fire; and the high east
Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.

 Let us not leave him out.

 Indeed he is not fit.

 Speak, hands, for me!

Casca first, then the other Conspirators and Marcus Brutus stab Cæsar.
 Go to the pulpit, Brutus.

"
233,jc-45,Trebonius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-45," There is no fear in him; let him not die;
For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.

Clock strikes.
 'Tis time to part.

 Cæsar, I will: Aside and so near will I be,
That your best friends shall wish I had been further.

 Fled to his house amazed:
Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
As it were doomsday.

"
234,jc-24,Ligarius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-24," Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.

 I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
Any exploit worthy the name of honor.

 By all the gods that Romans bow before,
I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
Brave son, derived from honorable loins!
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
And I will strive with things impossible;
Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?

 But are not some whole that we must make sick?

 Set on your foot,
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
That Brutus leads me on.

"
235,jc-19,Decius Brutus,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-19," Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?

 Shall no man else be touch'd but only Cæsar?

 Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
He says he does, being then most flattered.
Let me work;
For I can give his humor the true bent,
And I will bring him to the Capitol.

 Cæsar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Cæsar:
I come to fetch you to the senate-house.

 Most mighty Cæsar, let me know some cause,
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.

 This dream is all amiss interpreted;
It was a vision fair and fortunate:
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

 I have, when you have heard what I can say:
And know it now: the senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Cæsar.
If you shall send them word you will not come,
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
'Break up the senate till another time,
When Casar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
If Cæsar hide himself, shall they not whisper
Lo, Cæsar is afraid'?
Pardon me, Cæsar; for my dear dear love
To your proceeding bids me tell you this;
And reason to my love is liable.

 Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.

 Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
And presently prefer his suit to Cæsar.

 Great Cæsar,—

 And Cassius too.

 What, shall we forth?

"
236,jc-12,Metellus Cimber,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-12," O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
Will purchase us a good opinion
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
But all be buried in his gravity.

 Caius Ligarius doth bear Cæsar hard,
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
I wonder none of you have thought of him.

 Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Cæsar,
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
An humble heart,—
Kneeling.
 Is there no voice more worthy than my own
To sound more sweetly in great Cæsar's ear
For the repealing of my banish'd brother?

 Stand fast together, lest some friend of Cæsar's
Should chance—

"
237,jc-13,Cinna,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-13," To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?

 I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.

 Yes, you are.
O Cassius, if you could
But win the noble Brutus to our party—

 All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.

 O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.

 No, by no means.

 Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

 Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.

 O Cæsar,—

 Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.

 Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

"
238,jc-20,Flavius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-20," Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
Being mechanical, you ought not walk
Upon a laboring day without the sign
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?

 Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

 But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?

 Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
Into the channel, till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.

Exeunt all the Commoners.
See whether their basest metal be not moved;
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
This way will I: disrobe the images,
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.

 It is no matter; let no images
Be hung with Casar's trophies. I'll about,
And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
These growing feathers pluck'd from Casar's wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
Who else would soar above the view of men
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.

Exeunt.
"
239,jc-32,Marullus,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-32," Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You, sir, what trade are you?

 But what trade art thou? answer me directly.

 What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?

 What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!

 Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Knew you not Pompey ? Many a time and oft
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The live-long day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?
Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude.

 May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

"
241,jc-42,A Soothsayer,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-42," Cæsar!

 Beware the ides of March.

 Beware the ides of March.

 At mine own house, good lady.

 About the ninth hour, lady.

 Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
To see him pass on to the Capitol.

 That I have, lady: if it will please Cæsar
To be so good to Cæsar as to hear me,
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.

 None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
The throng that follows Cæsar at the heels,
Of senators, of prætors, common suitors,
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
I'll get me to a place more void, and there
Speak to great Cæsar as he comes along.

Exit.
 Ay, Cæsar; but not gone.

"
242,jc-14,Cinna,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-14," I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Cæsar,
And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
Yet something leads me forth.
Enter Citizens.
  Directly, I am going to Cæsar's fu neral.

 As a friend.

 Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.

 Truly, my name is Cinna.

 I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.

 I am not Cinna the conspirator.

"
243,jc-36,Another Poet.,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-36," Let me go in to see the generals;
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
They be alone. Nothing but death shall stay me.

Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS.
 For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.

"
244,jc-25,Lucilius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-25," Give the word, ho! and stand.

 He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master.

 With courtesy and with respect enough;
But not with such familiar instances,
Nor with such free and friendly conference,
As he hath used of old.

 They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
The greater part, the horse in general,
Are come with Cassius.

 You shall not come to them. My lord?

Brutus and Lucilius converse apart.
 O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.

 Only I yield to die:
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
Offering money. 
Kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.

 Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
I dare assure thee that no enemy
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
When you do find him, or alive or dead,
He will be found like Brutus, like himself.

 So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
That thou hast proved Lucilus' saying true.

"
245,jc-44,Titinius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-44," O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
Enter PINDARUS.
 They are, my lord.

 I will be here again, even with a thought.
Exit. 
 These tidings will well comfort Cassius.

 All disconsolate,
With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.

 He lies not like the living. O my heart!

 No, this was he, Messala,
But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.

 What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?

 Hie you, Messala,
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
Exit Messala.
Why didst though send me forth, brave Cassius?
Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
And bid me giv it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
By your leave, gods:—this is a Roman's part:
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart. Kills himself.
Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, young CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS.
"
246,jc-29,Messala,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-29," Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.

 That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
Have put to death an hundred senators.

 Cicero is dead,
And by that order of proscription.
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?

 Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

 That, methinks, is strange.

 No, my lord.

 Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.

 Even so great men great losses should endure.

 What says my general?

 Believe not so.

 It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
As Cassius' legions are by Antony.

 Where did you leave him?

 Is not that he that lies upon the ground?

 Is not that he ?

 Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
O hateful error, melancholy's child,
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!

 Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight.

 Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.

 My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?

 How died my master, Strato?

 Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
That did the latest service to my master.

"
247,jc-10,Young Cato,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-10," He is slain.

 Brave Titinius!
Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!

 What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field:
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!

"
248,jc-47,Volumnius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-47," What says my lord?

 Not so, my lord.

 That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
Alarum still. 
"
249,jc-46,Varro,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-46," Calls my lord?

 So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.

 My lord?

 No, my lord, I saw nothing.

"
250,jc-16,Clitus,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-16," Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.

 What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.

 I'll rather kill myself.

 O Dardanius!

 What ill request did Brutus make to thee?

 Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
That it runs over even at his eyes.

 Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.

 Fly, my lord, fly.

"
251,jc-15,Claudius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-15," My lord?

 Nor I, my lord.

"
252,jc-43,Strato,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-43," Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.

 Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
For Brutus only overcame himself,
And no man else hath honor by his death.

 Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.

 I held the sword, and he did run on it.

"
253,jc-26,Lucius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-26," Call'd you, my lord?

 I will, my lord.
Exit.
 The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
Searching the window for a flint, I found
This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
It did not lie there when I went to bed.

Gives him the letter.
 I know not, sir.

 I will, sir.
Exit.
 Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.

Knocking within.
 Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
Who doth desire to see you.

 No, sir, there are moe with him.

 No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
That by no means I may discover them
By any mark of favor.

 He is a sick man that would speak with you.

 To know my errand, madam.

 Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?

 I hear none, madam.

 Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
Enter the Soothsayer.
 Here in the tent.

 Varro and Claudius !
Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS.
 I was sure your lordship did not give it me.

 Ay, my lord, an't please you.

 It is my duty, sir.

 I have slept, my lord, already.

 The strings, my lord, are false.

 My lord?

 My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

 Nothing, my lord.

"
254,jc-18,Dardanius,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-18," Shall I do such a deed?

 O Clitus!

 To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.

"
255,jc-34,Pindarus,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-34," I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is, full of regard and honor.

 Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord:
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.

 O my lord!

 Titinius is enclosed round about
With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
He's ta'en. Shout.
And, hark! they shout for joy.

 So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
Where never Roman shall take note of him.

Exit. Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA. 
"
256,jc-6,Calpurnia,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-6," Here, my lord.

 What mean you, Cæsar? think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house to-day.

 Cæsar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
O Cæsar! these things are beyond all use,
And I do fear them.

 When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

 Alas, my lord,
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
And he shall say you are not well to-day:
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

 Say he is sick.

"
257,jc-38,Portia,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-38," Brutus, my lord!

 Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
Hoping it was but an effect of humor,
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
And could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

 Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
He would embrace the means to come by it.

 Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
To dare the vile contagion of the night
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
You have some sick offence within your mind,
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one,
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
Have had resort to you: for here have been
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
Even from darkness.

 I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
That appertain to you? Am I yourself
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
Of your good pleasure? if it be no more,
Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.

 If this were true, then should I know this secret.
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
Being so father'd and so husbanded?
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
I have made strong proof of my constancy,
Giving myself a voluntary wound
Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience,
And not my husband's secrets?

 I prithee, boy, run to the senatehouse;
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
Why dost thou stay?

 I would have had thee there, and here again,
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
O constancy, be strong upon my side,
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
Art thou here yet?

 Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
For he went sickly forth: and take good note
What Cæsar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy! what noise is that?

 Prithee, listen well;
I heard a bustling rumor, like a fray,
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.

 Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?

 What is't o'clock?

 Is Cæsar yet gone to the Capitol?

 Thou hast some suit to Cæsar, hast thou not?

 Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?

 I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
The heart of woman is ! O Brutus,
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise !
Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
That Cæsar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
Say I am merry: come to me again,
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

Exeunt severally.
"
259,cym.,CYMBELINE,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-cym.," Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!
If after this command thou fraught the court
With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!
Thou'rt poison to my blood.

 O disloyal thing,
That should'st repair my youth, thou heap'st
A year's age on me.

 Past grace? obedience?

 That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!

 Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
A seat for baseness.

 O thou vile one!

 What, art thou mad?

 Thou foolish thing!
Re-enter QUEEN.
They were again together: you have done
Not after our command. Away with her,
And pen her up.

 Nay, let her languish
A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,
Die of this folly!
Exeunt Cymbeline and Lords.
 Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
Will she not forth?

 The exile of her minion is too new;
She hath not yet forgot him: some more time
Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
And then she's yours.

 A worthy fellow,
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
But that's no fault of his: we must receive him
According to the honor of his sender;
And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
When you have given good morning to your mistress,
Attend the queen and us; we shall have need
To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.
[Exeunt all but Cloten. 
 Now say, what would Augustus Cæsar with us?

   Son, let your mother end.

 You must know,
Till the injurious Romans did extort
 This tribute from us, we were free: Cæsar's ambition,
Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
The sides o' the world, against all color here
Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
Ourselves to be.

 Say, then, to Cæsar,
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
 Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Cæsar
Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,
Who was the first of Britain which did put
His brows within a golden crown and call'd
Himself a king.

 Thou art welcome, Caius.
 Thy Cæsar knighted me; my youth I spent
Much under him; of him I gather'd honor;
Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
 So Cæsar shall not find them.

 I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
All the remain is 'Welcome!'  [Exeunt. Thus far; and so farewell.

 Our subjects, sir,
Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself
To show less sovereignty   than they, must needs
Appear unkinglike.

 My lords, you are appointed for that office;
The due of honor in no point omit.
So farewell, noble Lucius.

 Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!
[Exeunt Lucius and Lords.
 Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:
The powers that he already hath in Gallia
Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
His war for Britain.

 Our expectation that it would be thus
Hath made us forward.   But, my gentle queen,
Where is our daughter?   She hath not appear'd
Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
The duty of the day: she looks us like
A thing more made of malice than of duty:
We have noted it. Call her before us; for
We have been too slight in sufferance.
[Exit an Attendant.
 Where is she, sir?  How
Can her contempt be answer'd?

 Her doors lock'd?
Not seen of late?   Grant, heavens, that which I fear
Prove false!
[Exit.
 Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.
Exit an Attendant. 
A fever with the absence of her son,
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
How deeply you at once do touch me!   Imogen,
The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
So needful for this present: it strikes me, past
The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
Who needs must know of her departure and
Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee
By a sharp torture.

              The time is troublesome.
[To Pisanio]We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy
Does yet depend.

 Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
I am amazed with matter.

 I thank you. Let's withdraw;
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
What can from Italy annoy us; but
We grieve at chances here. Away!
[Exeunt all but Pisanio.
 Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast
Stepp'd before targes of proof, cannot be found:
He shall be happy that can find him, if
Our grace can make him so.

 No tidings of him?

 To my grief, I am
The heir of his reward; [To Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus] which I will add
To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,
By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
To ask of whence you are. Report it.

 Bow your knees.
Arise my knights o' the battle; I create you
Companions to our person and will fit you
With dignities becoming your estates.

Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies.
There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,
And not o' the court of Britain.

 Who worse than a physician
Would this report become?   But I consider,
By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?

 Prithee, say.

 She alone knew this;
And, but she spoke it dying, I would not
Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.

 O most delicate fiend!
Who is't can read a woman?   Is there more?

 Heard you all this, her women?

               Mine eyes
Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,
That thought her like her seeming; it had been vicious
To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!
That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
And prove it in thy feeling.   Heaven mend all!
Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS behind, and IMOGEN.
Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute; that
The Britons have razed out, though with the loss
Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:
So think of your estate.

 I have surely seen him:
His favor is familiar to me. Boy,
Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
To say, 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;
Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
The noblest ta'en.

 What wouldst thou, boy?
I love thee more and more: think more and more
What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,
Wilt have him alive?   Is he thy kin? thy friend?

 Wherefore eyest him so?

 Ay, with all my heart,
And lend my best attention.   What's thy name?

 Thou'rt my good youth, my page;
I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.
[Cymbeline and Imogen converse apart.
 Come, stand thou by our side;
Make thy demand aloud. [To Iachimo] Sir,
    step you forth;
Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;
Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
Which is our honor, bitter torture shall
Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.

 That diamond upon your finger, say
How came it yours?

 How! me?

 All that belongs to this.

 My daughter! what of her?   Renew thy strength:
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.

 I stand on fire:
Come to the matter.

 Nay, nay, to the purpose.

 Does the world go round?

 If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
To death with mortal joy.

 The tune of Imogen!

 New matter still?

 What's this, Cornelius?

 How now, my flesh, my child!
What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?
Wilt thou not speak to me?
 My tears that fall
Prove holy water on thee!   Imogen,
Thy mother's dead.

 O, she was naught; and long of her it was
That we meet here so strangely: but her son
Is gone, we know not how nor where.

 Marry, the gods forfend!
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Pluck a hard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,
Deny't again.

 He was a prince.

 I am sorry for thee:
By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
Endure our law: thou'rt dead.

 Bind the offender,
And take him from our presence.

 Why, old soldier,
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
By tasting of our wrath?   How of descent
As good as we?

 And thou shalt die for't.

 What of him? he is
A banish'd traitor.

 Take him hence:
The whole world shall not save him.

 Nursing of my sons!

 How! my issue!

 Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
The service that you three have done is more
Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:
If these be they, I know not how to wish
A pair of worthier sons.

 Guiderius had
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
It was a mark of wonder.

 O, what, am I
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
Rejoiced deliverance more.   Blest pray you be,
That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
You may reign in them now! O Imogen,
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.

 Did you e'er meet?

 O rare instinct!
When shall I hear all through?   This fierce abridgement
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived you?
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
And your three motives to the battle, with
I know not how much more, should be demanded;
And all the other by-dependencies,
From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place
Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting
Each object with a joy: the counterchange
Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
[To Belarius]Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.

 All o'erjoy'd,
Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,
For they shall taste our comfort.

 The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
He would have well becomed this place, and graced
The thankings of a king.

 Nobly doom'd!
We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
Pardon's the word to all.

 This hath some seeming.

 Well;
My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
 Although the victor, we submit to Cæsar,
And to the Roman empire; promising
To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
Have laid most heavy hand.

 Laud we the gods;
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
A Roman and a British ensign wave
Friendly together:   so through Lud's-town march:
And in the temple of great Jupiter
Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
Set on there!   Never was a war did cease,
Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
Exeunt. "
261,post.,POSTHUMUS LEONATUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-post.," Please your highness,
I will from hence to-day.

 My queen! my mistress!
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
To be suspected of more tenderness
Than doth become a man. I will remain
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
Who to my father was a friend, to me
Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
Though ink be made of gall.
Re-enter QUEEN.
 Should we be taking leave
As long a term as yet we have to live,
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

 How, how, another?
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
And sear up my embracements from a next
With bonds of death! [Putting on the ring.]
Remain, remain thou here
While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
As I my poor self did exchange for you,
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
I still win of you: for my sake wear this;
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
Upon this fairest prisoner.
[Putting a bracelet upon her arm.
 Alack, the king!

 The gods protect you!
And bless the good remainders of the court!
I am gone.
[Exit.
                    Fear it not, sir: I would I were so
sure
To win the king as I am bold her honor
Will remain hers.

 Not any, but abide the change of time,
Quake in the present winter's state and wish
That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,
I barely gratify your love; they failing,
I must die much your debtor.

 I do believe,
Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
 Are men more order'd than when Julius Cæsar
Smiled at their lack of skill, but found their courage
Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,
Now mingled with their courages, will make known
To their approvers they are people such
That mend upon the world.
Enter IACHIMO.
 The swiftest harts have posted you by land;
And winds of all the corners kiss'd your sails,
To make your vessel nimble.

 I hope the briefness of your answer made
The speediness of your return.

 And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
Look through a casement to allure false hearts
And be false with them.

 Their tenor good, I trust.

 All is well yet.
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not
Too dull for your good wearing?

 The stone's too hard to come by.

 Make not, sir,
Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we
Must not continue friends.

 If you can make't apparent
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion
You had of her pure honor gains or loses
Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both
To who shall find them.

              Proceed.

                      This is true;
And this you might have heard of here, by me,
Or by some other.

 So they must,
Or do your honor injury.

 This is a thing
Which you might for relation likewise reap,
Being, as it is, much spoke of.

 This is her honor!
Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
Be given to your remembrance--the description
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
The wager you have laid.

 Jove!
Once more let me behold it: is it that
Which I left with her?

 May be she pluck'd it off
To send it me.

 O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;    [Gives the ring. 
It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
Kills me to look on 't. Let there be no honor
Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,
Where there's another man: the vows of women
Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,
Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.
O, above measure false!

 Very true;
And so, I hope, he came by 't. Back my ring:
Render to me some corporal sign about her,
More evident than this; for this was stolen.

 Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
'Tis true:--nay. keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure
She would not lose it: her attendants are
All sworn and honorable:--they induced to steal it!
And by a stranger!   No, he hath enjoyed her:
The cognizance of her incontinency
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
Divide themselves between you!

 Never talk on't;
She hath been colted by him.

                 Ay, and it doth confirm
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
Were there no more but it.

 Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;
Once, and a million!

 No swearing.
If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny
Thou'st made me cuckold.

 O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
I will go there and do't, i' the court, before
Her father. I'll do something--   [Exit.
 Is there no way for men to be but women
Must be half-workers?   We are all bastards;
And that most venerable man which I
Did call my father, was I know not where
When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools
Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd
The Dian of that time: so doth my wife
The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils I
This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--was't not?--
Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,
Like all a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition
But what he look'd for should oppose and she
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
The woman's part in me!   For there's no motion
That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,
The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
All faults that may be named, nay that hell knows,
Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;
For even to vice
They are not constant, but are changing still
One vice, but of a minute old, for one
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,
Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
In a true hate, to pray they have their will:
The very devils cannot plague them better.
[Exit. Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd
Thou shouldst be color'd thus. You married ones,
If each of you should take this course, how many
Must murder wives much better than themselves
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
Every good servant does not all commands:
No bond but to do just ones. God! if you
Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never
Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
The noble Imogen to repent and struck
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,
You snatch some hence for little faults: that's love,
To have them fall no more: you some permit
To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,
And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough
That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!
I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight
Against the part I come with; so I'll die
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
More valor in me than my habits show.
Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!
To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin
The fashion, less without and more within.
[Exit. I did:
Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.

 No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,
But that the heavens fought: the king himself
Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying
Through a straight lane; the enemy full- hearted,
Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work
More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down
Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd
With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
To die with lengthen'd shame.

 Close by the battle ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
An honest one, I warrant; who deserved
So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,
He, with two striplings--lads more like to run
The country base than to commit such slaughter;
With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
Than those for preservation cased, or shame,--
Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,
'Our Britain's harts die flying, not our men:
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;
Or we are Romans and will give you that
Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
But to look back in frown: stand, stand.' These three,
Three thousand confident, in act as many--
For three performers are the file when all
The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'
Accommodated by the place, more charming
With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,
Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some, turn'd coward
But by example--O, a sin in war,
Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
The way that they did, and to grin like lions
Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon
A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly
Chickens, the way which they stopp'd eagles; slaves,
The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,
Like fragments in hard voyages, became
The life o' the need: having found the back-door open
Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
Some slain before; some dying; some their friends
O'er-borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,
Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:
Those that would die or ere resist are grown
The mortal bugs o' the field.

 Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
Rather to wonder at the things you hear
Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
And vent it for a mockery?   Here is one:
'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,
Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'

 'Lack, to what end?
Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
For if he'll do as he is made to do,
I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
You have put me into rhyme.

 Still going? [Exit Lord. This is a
lord! O noble misery,
To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!
To-day how many would have given their honors
To have saved their carcases! took heel to do't,
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we
That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him:
For being now a favorer to the Briton,
No more a Briton, I have resumed again
The part I came in: fight I will no more,
But yield to me to the veriest hind that shall
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
Britons must take.   For me, my ransom's death;
On either side I come to spend my breath;
Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
But end it by some means for Imogen.
Enter two British Captains and Soldiers.
 A Roman,
Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds
Had answer'd him.

 Most welcome, bondage! for thou art a way,
I think, to liberty: yet am I better
Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
By the sure physician, death, who is the key
To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
Then, free for ever! Is 't enough I am sorry?
So children temporal fathers do appease;
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
I cannot do it better than in gyves,
Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,
If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
No stricter render of me than my all.
I know you are more clement than vile men,
Who of their broken debtors take a third,
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
On their abatement: that's not my desire:
For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:
You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,
If you will take this audit, take this life,
And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
I'll speak to thee in silence.    [Sleeps.
Solemn music.
Enter, as in an apparition, SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus, an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother to Posthumus, with music before them: then, after other music, follow the two young LEONATI, brothers to Posthumus, with wounds as they died in the wars. They circle POSTHUMUS round, as he lies sleeping.
 Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
On greatness' favor dream as I have done,
Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
And yet are steep'd in favors; so am I,
That have this golden chance and know not why.
What fairies haunt this ground? A book?   O rare one!
Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects
So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
As good as promise.
 [Reads]'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
The action of my life is like it, which
I'll keep, if but for sympathy.
Re-enter Gaolers.
        What's to him?

 Ay, so thou dost,
Italian fiend! Ay, me, most credulous fool,
Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
That's due to all the villains past, in being,
To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out
For torturers ingenious: it is I
That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
By being worse than they.   I am Posthumus,
That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--
That caused a lesser villain than myself,
A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple
Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain
Be call'd Posthumus Leonatus; and
Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!
My queen, my life, my wife!   O Imogen,
Imogen, Imogen!

 Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
There lie thy part.  [Striking her: she falls.
 How come these staggers on me?

 Hang there like fruit, my soul,
Till the tree die!

 I am, sir,
The soldier that did company these three
In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might
Have made you finish.

 Kneel not to me:
The power that I have on you is to spare you;
The malice towards you to forgive you: live,
And deal with others better.

 Your servant, princes.   Good my lord of Rome,
Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought
Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
This label on my bosom; whose containing
Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
Make no collection of it: let him show
His skill in the construction.

"
262,bel.,BELARIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-bel.," A goodly day not to keep house, with such
Whose roof's as low as ours!   Stoop, boys; this gate
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs
Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbans on, without
Good morrow to the sun.   Hail, thou fair heaven!
We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
As prouder livers do.

 Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,
When you above perceive me like a crow,
That it is place which lessens and sets off:
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:
This service is not service, so being done
But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,
Draws us a profit from all things we see;
And often, to our comfort, shall we find
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
Is nobler than attending for a check,
Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,
Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.

 How you speak!
Did you but know the city's usuries
And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court,
As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
Is certain falling, or so slippery that
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
I' the name of fame and honor; which dies i' the search,
And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
As record of fair act; nay, many times,
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story
The world may read in me: my body's mark'd
With Roman swords, and my report was once
First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,
And when a soldier was the theme, my name
Was not far off: then was I as a tree
Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night,
A storm of robbery, call it what you will,
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
And left me bare to weather.

 My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans: so
Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
This rock and these demesnes have been my world;
Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
More pious debts to heaven than in all
The fore-end of my time.   But up to the mountains!
This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;
To him the other two shall minister;
And we will fear no poison, which attends
In place of greater state.   I'll meet you in the valleys.
[Exeunt Guiderius and Arviragus.
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
These boys know little they are sons to the king;
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
They think they are mine; and though train'd up thus meanly
I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
In simple and low things to prince it much
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
Into my story: say 'Thus mine enemy fell,
And thus I set my foot on's neck;' even then
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
That acts my words.   The younger brother, Cadwal,
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,
At three and two years old, I stole these babes;
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,
Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,
And every day do honor to her grave:
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
They take for natural father.   The game is up.
[Exit.  You, Polydore, have proved best woodman and
Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I
Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:
The sweat of industry would dry and die,
But for the end it works to.   Come; our stomachs
Will make what's homely savoury: weariness
Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
Poor house, that keep'st thyself!

 Stay; come not in.
But that it eats our victuals, I should think
Here were a fairy.

 By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
An earthly paragon!   Behold divineness
No elder than a boy!
Re-enter IMOGEN.
 Whither bound?

 What's your name?

 Prithee, fair youth
Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
By this rude place we live in.   Well encounter'd!
'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer
Ere you depart; and thanks to stay and eat it.
Boys, bid him welcome.

 He wrings at some distress.

 Hark, boys!
[Whispering.
 It shall be so.
Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:
Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,
We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
So far as thou wilt speak it.

 You are not well: remain here in the cave;
We'll come to you after hunting.

 What! how! how!

 O noble strain!
O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:
Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
I'm not their father; yet who this should be,
Doth miracle itself, loved before me.
'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.

 To the field, to the field
We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.

 Pray, be not sick,
For you must be our housewife.

 And shalt be ever.
[Exit Imogen, to the cave.
This youth, howe'er distress'd, appears he hath had
Good ancestors.

 It is great morning. Come, away!--
Who's there?
Enter CLOTEN.
 'Those runagates!'
Means he not us?   I partly know him: 'tis
Cloten, the son o' the queen.   I fear some ambush.
I saw him not these many years, and yet
I know 'tis he.   We are held as outlaws: hence!

 No companies abroad?

 I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,
But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favor
Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute
'Twas very Cloten.

 Being scarce made up,
I mean, to man, he had not apprehension
Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgement
Is oft the cause of fear.   But, see, thy brother.
Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head.
 What hast thou done?

 We are all undone.

 No single soul
Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason
He must have some attendants. Though his humor
Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not
Absolute madness could so far have raved
To bring him here alone; although perhaps
It may be heard at court that such as we
Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--
As it is like him--might break out, and swear
He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable
To come alone, either he so undertaking,
Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,
If we do fear this body hath a tail
More perilous than the head.

 I had no mind
To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness
Did make my way long forth.

 I fear 'twill be revenged:
Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done't! though valor
Becomes thee well enough.

 Well, 'tis done:
We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger
Where's there no profit.   I prithee, to our rock;
You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay
Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him
To dinner presently.

 O thou goddess,
Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st
In these two princely boys!   They are as gentle
As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,
That by the top doth take the mountain pine,
And make him stoop to the vale.   'Tis wonder
That an invisible instinct should frame them
To royalty unlearn'd, honor untaught,
Civility not seen from other, valor
That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
What Cloten's being here to us portends,
Or what his death will bring us.
Re-enter GUIDERIUS.
 My ingenious instrument!
Hark, Polydore, it sounds!   But what occasion
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion?   Hark!

 He went hence even now.

 Look, here he comes,
And brings the dire occasion in his arms
Of what we blame him for.
Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead,
                       bearing her in his arms.
 O melancholy!
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare
Might easiliest harbor in?   Thou blessed thing!
Jove knows what man thou might'st have made; but I,
Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
How found you him?

 Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten
Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
And though he came our enemy, remember
He was paid for that: though mean and mighty, rotting
Together, have one dust, yet reverence,
That angel of the world, doth make distinction
Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely;
And though you took his life, as being our foe,
Yet bury him as a prince.

 Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:
The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night
Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.
You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so
These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.
Come on, away: apart upon our knees.
The ground that gave them first has them again:
Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.
[Exeunt Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus. 
 Let us from it.

 Sons,
We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.
To the king's party there's no going: newness
Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd
Among the bands--may drive us to a render
Where we have lived, and so extort from's that
Which we have done, whose answer would be death
Drawn on with torture.

 O, I am known
Of many in the army: many years,
Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
From my remembrance.   And, besides, the king
Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;
Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless
To have the courtesy your cradle promised,
But to be still hot summer's tanlings and
The shrinking slaves of winter.

 No reason I, since of your lives you set
So slight a valuation, should reserve
My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!
If in your country wars you chance to die,
That is my bed too, lads, and there I'll lie:
Lead, lead.   [Aside] The time seems long;
their blood thinks scorn,
Till it fly out and show them princes born.  Exeunt. Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;
The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but
The villany of our fears.

 I never saw
Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
Such precious deeds in one that promised nought
But beggary and poor looks.

 Sir,
In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:
Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
Unless I add, we are honest.

 Is not this boy revived from death?

 Peace, peace! see further: he eyes us not; forbear;
Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure
He would have spoke to us.

 Be silent; let's see further.

 My boys,
There was our error.

 Though you did love this youth, I blame ye not;
You had a motive for 't.

 Stay, sir king:
This man is better than the man he slew,
As well descended as thyself; and hath
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
Had ever scar for. [To the Guard] Let his arms alone;
They were not born for bondage.

 We will die all three:
But I will prove that two on's are as good
As I have given out him. My sons, I must,
For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,
Though, haply, well for you.

 Have at it then, by leave.
Thou hadst, great king, a subject who
Was call'd Belarius.

 He it is that hath
Assumed this age: indeed a banish'd man;
I know not how a traitor.

 Not too hot:
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
And let it be confiscate all, so soon
As I have received it.

 I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:
Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
These two young gentlemen, that call me father
And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
And blood of your begetting.

 So sure as you your father's.   I, old Morgan,
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:
Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
Was all the harm I did.   These gentle princes--
For such and so they are--these twenty years
Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,
Having received the punishment before,
For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty
Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
Here are your sons again; and I must lose
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
The benediction of these covering heavens
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
To inlay heaven with stars.

 Be pleased awhile.
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:
This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
Of his queen mother, which for more probation
I can with ease produce.

 This is he;
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:
It was wise nature's end in the donation,
To be his evidence now.

"
263,gui.,GUIDERIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-gui.,"         Hail, heaven!

 Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,
Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not
What air's from home.   Haply this life is best,
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
That have a sharper known; well corresponding
With your stiff age: but unto us it is
A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;
A prison for a debtor, that not dares
To stride a limit.

 Uncertain favor!

 I am thoroughly weary.

 There is cold meat i' the cave: we'll browse on that,
Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.

 What's the matter, sir?

 Money, youth?

 Were you a woman, youth,
I should woo hard but be your groom.   In honesty,
I bid for you as I'ld buy.

 Would I could free't!

 Pray, draw near.

 Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.

 I love thee; I have spoke it:
How much the quantity, the weight as much,
As I do love my father.

 I could not stir him:
He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.

 But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
In characters,
And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick
And he her dieter.

 I do note
That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
Mingle their spurs together.

 He is but one: you and my brother search
What companies are near: pray you, away;
Let me alone with him.
[Exeunt Belarius and Arviragus.
 A thing
More slavish did I ne'er than answering
A slave without a knock.

 To who? to thee?   What art thou? Have not I
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art.
Why I should yield to thee?

 No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
Which, as it seems, make thee.

 Hence, then, and thank
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
I am loath to beat thee.

 What's thy name?

 Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,
'Twould move me sooner.

 I am sorry for't; not seeming
So worthy as thy birth.

 Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:
At fools I laugh, not fear them.

 This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
There was no money in 't: not Hercules
Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
My head as I do his.

 I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
Son to the queen, after his own report;
Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
With his own single hand he'ld take us in,
Displace our heads where--thank the gods!-- they grow,
And set them on Lud's-town.

 Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,
But that he swore to take, our lives?   The law
Protects not us: then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
Play judge and executioner all himself,
For we do fear the law?   What company
Discover you abroad?

 With his own sword,
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,
And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:
That's all I reck.
[Exit.
 Where's my brother?
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage
For his return.  [Solemn music.
 Is he at home?

 What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
It did not speak before. All solemn things
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
Is Cadwal mad?

 O sweetest, fairest lily!
My brother wears thee not the one half so well
As when they grew'st thyself.

                 Where?

 Why, he but sleeps:
If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
And worms will not come to thee.

 Prithee, have done;
And do not play in wench-like words with that
Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
And not protract with admiration what
Is now due debt. To the grave!

 By good Euriphile, our mother.

 Cadwal,
I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
Than priests and fanes that lie.

 Pray you, fetch him hither.
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
When neither are alive.

 Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;
My father hath a reason for't.

 Come on then, and remove him.

 Fear no more the heat o' the sun,
 Nor the furious winter's rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
 Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:""
Golden lads and girls all must,
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

 Fear no more the lightning-flash,

 Fear not slander, censure rash;

 No exorciser harm thee!

 Ghost unlaid forbear thee!

 We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.

 The noise is round about us.

 Nay, what hope
Have we in hiding us?   This way, the Romans
Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
During their use, and slay us after.

 This is, sir, a doubt
In such a time nothing becoming you,
Nor satisfying us.

 Than be so
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:
I and my brother are not known; yourself
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
Cannot be question'd.

 By heavens, I'll go:
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
I'll take the better care, but if you will not,
The hazard therefore due fall on me by
The hands of Romans!

 The same dead thing alive.

 But we saw him dead.

 This is, sure, Fidele.

 Let me end the story:
I slew him there.

 I have spoke it, and I did it.

 A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
With language that would make me spurn the sea,
If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine.

 And our good his.

 And at first meeting loved;
Continued so, until we thought he died.

"
264,arv.,ARVIRAGUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-arv.," Hail, heaven!

 What should we speak of
When we are old as you? when we shall hear
The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse
The freezing hours away?   We have seen nothing;
We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;
Our valor is to chase what flies; our cage
We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,
And sing our bondage freely.

 I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.

 All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those
Who worship dirty gods.

 I'll make't my comfort
He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:
And such a welcome as I'ld give to him
After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!
Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.

 Or I, whate'er it be,
What pain it cost, what danger. Gods!

 The night to the owl and morn to the lark less welcome.

 I pray, draw near.
[Exeunt. Brother, stay here:
Are we not brothers?

 If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me
In my good brother's fault: I know not why
I love this youth; and I have heard you say,
Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,
And a demand who is't shall die, I'ld say
'My father, not this youth.'

 Brother, farewell.

 You health.   So please you, sir.

 Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter
I might know more.

 We'll not be long away.

 How angel-like he sings.

 Nobly he yokes
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
Was that it was, for not being such a smile;
The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly
From so divine a temple, to commix
With winds that sailors rail at.

 Grow, patience!
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
His perishing root with the increasing vine!

 None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.

 In this place we left them:
I wish my brother make good time with him,
You say he is so fell.

 Let ordinance
Come as the gods foresay it; howsoe'er,
My brother hath done well.

 Would I had done't,
So the revenge alone pursued me!   Polydore,
I love thee brotherly, but envy much
Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,
That possible strength might meet, would seek us through
And put us to our answer.

 Poor sick Fidele!
I'll willingly to him: to gain his color
I'ld let a parish of such Clotens blood,
And praise myself for charity.
[Exit.
 The bird is dead
That we have made so much on.   I had rather
Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,
Than have seen this.

 Stark, as you see:
Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,
Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his right cheek
Reposing on a cushion.

 O' the floor;
His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put
My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
Answer'd my steps too loud.

 With fairiest flowers
Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor
The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
Out-sweeten'd not thy breath; the ruddock would,
With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
Without a monument!--bring thee all this;
Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,
To winter-ground thy corse.

 Say, where shall's lay him?

 Be't so:
And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,
As once our mother; use like note and words,
Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.

 We'll speak it, then.

 If you'll go fetch him,
We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.
[Exit Belarius. 
 'Tis true.

 So. Begin,
SONG.
 Fear no more the frown o' the great;
 Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;
Care no more to clothe and eat;
 To thee the reed is as the oak:
The sceptre, learning, physic, must
All follow this, and come to dust.

  Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;

  Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:

 Nor no witchcraft charm thee!

 Nothing ill come near thee!

 What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
From action and adventure?

 It is not likely
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
That they will waste their time upon our note,
To know from whence we are.

 By this sun that shines,
I'll thither: what thing is it that I never
Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,
But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
Nor iron on his heel!   I am ashamed
To look upon the holy sun, to have
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
So long a poor unknown.

 So say I: amen.

 One sand another
Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?

 In that he spake too far.

 Your danger's ours.

 Ay, my good lord.

 You holp us, sir,
As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
Joy'd are we that you are.

"
265,phi.,PHILARIO,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-phi.,"       What means do you make to him?

 Your very goodness and your company
O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius
Will do's commission throughly: and I think
He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
Is yet fresh in their grief.

 See! Iachimo!

 Welcome, sir.

 Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
When you were there?

 Have patience, sir,
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
It may be probable she lost it; or
Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,
Hath stol'n it from her?

 Sir, be patient:
This is not strong enough to be believed
Of one persuaded well of--

 Quite besides
The government of patience!   You have won:
Let's follow   him, and pervert the present wrath
He hath against himself.

"
266,iach.,IACHIMO,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-iach.,"                     Change you, madam?
The worthy Leonatus is in safety
And greets your highness dearly.
[Presents a letter.
 All of her that is out of door most rich!
If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
She is alone the Arabian bird, and I
Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
Rather, directly fly.

 Thanks, fairest lady.
What, are men mad?   Hath nature given them eyes
To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
Partition make with spectacles so precious
'Twixt fair and foul?

 It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys
'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgement,
For idiots in this case of favor would
Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
Should make desire vomit emptiness,
Not so allured to feed.

 The cloyed will,
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb,
Longs after for the garbage.

 Thanks, madam; well.  [To Pisanio]
Beseech you, sir, desire
My man's abode where I did leave him: he
Is strange and peevish.

 Well, madam.

 Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
The Briton reveller.

 I never saw him sad.
There is a Frenchman his companion, one
An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces
The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--
Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
By history, report, or his own proof,
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
But must be, will his free hours languish for
Assured bondage?'

 Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:
It is a recreation to be by
And hear him mock the Frenchman.   But, heavens know,
Some men are much to blame.

 Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
Be used more thankfully.   In himself, 'tismuch;
In you, which I account his beyond all talents,
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
To pity too.

 Two creatures heartily.

 Lamentable!  What,
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
I' the dungeon by a snuff?

 That others do--
I was about to say--enjoy your--But
It is an office of the gods to venge it,
Not mine to speak on 't.

 Had I this cheek
To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as
With labor; then by-peeping in an eye
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
That all the plagues of hell should at one time
Encounter such revolt.

 And himself. Not I,
Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
Charms this report out.

 O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd
With tomboys hired with that self exhibition
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
That play with all infirmities for gold
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
As well might poison poison!   Be revenged;
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
Recoil from your great stock.

 Should he make me
Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
While he is vaulting variable ramps,
In your despite, upon your purse?   Revenge it.
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
More noble than that runagate to your bed,
And will continue fast to your affection,
Still close as sure.

 Let me my service tender on your lips.

 O happy Leonatus!   I may say:
The credit that thy lady hath of thee
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
Her assured credit.   Blessed live you long!
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
For the most worthiest fit!   Give me your pardon.
I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,
That which he is, new o'er: and he is one
The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
That he enchants societies into him;
Half all men's hearts are his.

 He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
He hath a kind of honor sets him off,
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
To try your taking of a false report; which hath
Honor'd with confirmation your great judgement
In the election of a sir so rare,
Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him
Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.

 My humble thanks.   I had almost forgot
To entreat your grace but in a small request,
And yet of moment too, for it concerns
Your lord; myself and other noble friends
Are partners in the business.

 Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
To buy a present for the emperor;
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
And I am something curious, being strange,
To have them in safe stowage: may it please you
To take them in protection?

 They are in a trunk,
Attended by my men: I will make bold
To send them to you, only for this night;
I must aboard to-morrow.

 Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
By lengthening my return.   From Gallia
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
To see your grace.

 O, I must, madam:
Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
To greet your lord with writing, do't tonight:
I have outstood my time; which is material
To the tender of our present.

 The crickets sing, and man's o'er- labor'd sense
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,
And whiter than the sheets!   That I might touch!
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
How dearly they do't!  'Tis her breathing that
Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
Under these windows, white and azure laced
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,
To note the chamber: I will write all down:
Such and such pictures; there the window; such
The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,
Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.
Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
Above ten thousand meaner moveables
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
And be her sense but as a monument,
Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:
[Taking off her bracelet. 
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
As strongly as the conscience does within,
To the madding of her lord.   On her left breast
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,
Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
The treasure of her honor. No more. To what end?
Why should I write this down, that's riveted,
Screw'd to my memory?   She hath been reading late
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
May bare the raven's eye!   I lodge in fear;
Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.
[Clock strikes.
One, two, three: time, time!
[Goes into the trunk. The scene closes. Your lady
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.

 Here are letters for you.

 'Tis very like.

 He was expected then,
But not approached.

 If I had lost it,
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy
A second night of such sweet shortness which
Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.

 Not a whit,
Your lady being so easy.

 Good sir, we must,
If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
We were to question further: but I now
Profess myself the winner of her honor,
Together with your ring; and not the wronger
Of her or you, having proceeded but
By both your wills.

 Sir, my circumstances,
Being so near the truth as I will make them,
Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,
You I'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
You need it not.

 First, her bedchamber,--
Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess
Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd
With tapestry of silk and silver; the story
Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
The press of boats or pride: a piece of work
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
Since the true life on't was--

 More particulars
Must justify my knowledge.

 The chimney
Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures
So likely to report themselves: the cutter
Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,
Motion and breath left out.

 The roof o' the chamber
With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--
I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
Depending on their brands.

 Then, if you can,
[Showing the bracelet.
Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!
And now 'tis up again: it must be married
To that your diamond; I'll keep them.

 Sir--I thank her--that:
She stripped it from her arm; I see her yet;
Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said
She prized it once.

         She writes so to you, doth she?

 By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.

 If you seek
For further satisfying, under her breast--
Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud
Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,
I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger.
To feed again, though full. You do remember
This stain upon her?

 Will you hear more?

           I'll be sworn--

 I'll deny nothing.

 With all my heart.
[Exeunt. The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,
The princess of this country, and the air on't
Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,
A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me
In my profession?   Knighthoods and honors, borne
As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.
If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.
[Exit.
The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.
 'Tis their fresh supplies.

 Thou't torture me to leave unspoken that
Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.

 I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
Which torments me to conceal. By villany
I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;
Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may grieve thee,
As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?

 That paragon, thy daughter,--
For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.

 Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
That struck the hour--it was in Rome,--accursed
The mansion where!   'twas at a feast,--O, would
Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--
What should I say? he was too good to be
Where ill men were; and was the best of all
Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming
The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva,
Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,
A shop of all the qualities that man
Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
Fairness which strikes the eye--

 All too soon I shall,
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
Most like a noble lord in love and one
That had a royal lover, took his hint;
And, not dispraising whom we praised,-- therein
He was as calm as virtue--he began
His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made,
And then a mind put in't, either our brags
Were crack'd of kitchen-trulls, or his description
Proved us unspeaking sots.

 Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,
Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him
Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
Upon his honor'd finger, to attain
In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
No lesser of her honor confident
Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
And would so, had it been a carbuncle
Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
Post I in this design: well may you, sir,
Remember me at court; where I was taught
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
'Twixt amorous and villanous.   Being thus quench'd
Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
'Gan in your duller Britain operate
Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:
And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd,
That I return'd with simular proof enough
To make the noble Leonatus mad,
By wounding his belief in her renown
With tokens thus, and thus; averring notes
Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--
O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
Of secret on her person, that he could not
But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--
Methinks, I see him now--
 I am down again:
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
Which I so often owe: but your ring first;
And here the bracelet of the truest princess
That ever swore her faith.

"
267,luc.,CAIUS LUCIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-luc.," When Julius Cæsar, whose remembrance yet
Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--
 Famous in Cæsar's praises, no whit less
Than in his feats deserving it--for him
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
Is left untender'd.

 I am sorry, Cymbeline,
 That I am to pronounce Augustus Cæsar--
  Cæsar, that hath more kings his servants than
Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
 In Cæsar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
I thank thee for myself.

 Let proof speak.

 So, sir.

 Thanks, royal sir.
My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;
And am right sorry that I must report ye
My master's enemy.

 So, sir; I desire of you
A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.
Madam, all joy befal your grace!
 Your hand, my lord.

 Sir, the event
Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.

 But what from Rome?

 When expect you them?

 This forwardness
Makes our hopes fair.   Command our present numbers
Be muster'd; bid the captains look to 't. Now, sir,
What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?

 Dream often so,
And never false.   Soft, ho! what trunk is here
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
It was a worthy building. How! a page!
Or dead, or sleeping on him?   But dead rather;
For nature doth abhor to make his bed
With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.
Let's see the boy's face.

 He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
They crave to be demanded.   Who is this
Thou makest thy bloody pillow?   Or who was he
That, otherwise than noble nature did,
Hath alter'd that good picture?   What's thy interest
In this sad wreck?   How came it?   Who is it?
What art thou?

 'Lack, good youth!
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.

                   Thy name?

 Thou dost approve thyself the very same:
Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
Wilt take thy chance with me?   I will not say
Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,
No less beloved.   The Roman emperor's letters,
Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.

 Ay, good youth;
And rather father thee than master thee.
My friends,
The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
And make him with our pikes and partisans
A grave: come, arm him.   Boy, he is preferr'd
By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd
As soldiers can.   Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes:
Some falls are means the happier to arise.
[Exeunt. Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;
For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
As war were hoodwink'd.

 It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes
Let's re-inforce, or fly.    [Exeunt. Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,
We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten'd
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:
Augustus lives to think on't: and so much
For my peculiar care. This one thing only
I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,
Let him be ransom'd: never master had
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
So tender over his occasions, true,
So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join
With my request, which I'll make bold your highness
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,
Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,
And spare no blood beside.

 I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;
And yet I know thou wilt.

 The boy disdains me,
He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
Why stands he so perplex'd?

 Happy be you!

 Philarmonus!

 Read, and declare the meaning.

"
268,pis.,PISANIO,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-pis.," My lord your son drew on my master.

 There might have been,
But that my master rather play'd than fought
And had no help of anger: they were parted
By gentlemen at hand.

 On his command: he would not suffer me
To bring him to the haven; left these notes
Of what commands I should be subject to,
When't pleased you to employ me.

 I humbly thank your highness.

 It was his queen, his queen!

 And kiss'd it, madam.

 No, madam; for so long
As he could make me with this eye or ear
Distinguish him from others, he did keep
The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of's mind
Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
How swift his ship.

 Madam, so I did.

 Be assured, madam,
With his next vantage.

 Madam, I shall.
[Exeunt.  And shall do:
But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.
[Exit. Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
Comes from my lord with letters.

 I was going, sir,
To give him welcome.  [Exit.
 'Twill not be lost.

 How! of adultery?   Wherefore write you not
What monster's her accuser?   Leonatus!
O master! what a strange infection
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,
As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd
On thy too ready hearing?   Disloyal!   No:
She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
As would take in some virtue. O my master!
Thy mind to her is now as low as were
Thy fortunes.   How! that I should murder her?
Upon the love and truth and vows which I
Have made to thy command?   I, her? her blood?
If it be so to do good service, never
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,
That I should seem to lack humanity
So much as this fact comes to? [Reading]
   'Do't: the letter
That I have sent her, by her own command
Shall give thee opportunity.'   O damn'd paper!
Black as the ink that's on thee!   Senseless bauble,
Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
Enter IMOGEN.
 Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

 One score 'twixt sun and sun,
Madam, 's enough for you: [Aside] and too
 much too.

 Madam, you're best consider.

 Please you, read;
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
The most disdain'd of fortune.
 What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
This viperous slander enters.   What cheer, madam?

 Alas, good lady!

 Good madam, hear me.

 Hence, vile instrument!
Thou shalt not damn my hand.

 O gracious lady,
Since I received command to do this business
I have not slept one wink.

 I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.

 But to win time
To lose so bad employment; in the which
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
Hear me with patience.

 Then, madam,
I thought you would not back again.

 Not so, neither:
But if I were as wise as honest, then
My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
But that my master is abused:
Some villain, ay, and singular in his art,
Hath done you both this cursed injury.

 No, on my life.
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded
I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
And that will well confirm it.

 If you'll back to the court--

 If not at court,
Then not in Britain must you bide.

 I am most glad
You think of other place.   The ambassador,
Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
That which, to appear itself, must not yet be
But by self-danger, you should tread a course
Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least
That though his actions were not visible, yet
Report should render him hourly to your ear
As truly as he moves.

 Well, then, here's the point:
You must forget to be a woman; change
Command into obedience: fear and niceness--
The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
Woman it pretty self--into a waggish courage:
Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and
As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch
Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
Your laborsome and dainty trims, wherein
You made great Juno angry.

 First, make yourself but like one.
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--
'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all
That answer to them: would you in their serving,
And with what imitation you can borrow
From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
Wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,
If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless
With joy he will embrace you, for he's honorable
And doubling that, most holy.   Your means abroad,
You have me, rich; and I will never fail
Beginning nor supplyment.

 Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
Your carriage from the court.   My noble mistress,
Here is a box; I had it from the queen:
What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,
Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
Direct you to the best!

 O, my good lord!

 Alas, my lord,
How can she be with him?   When was she miss'd?
He is in Rome.

 O, my all-worthy lord!

 Then, sir,
This paper is the history of my knowledge
Touching her flight.   [Presenting a letter.
 Or this, or perish.
She's far enough; and what he learns by this
May prove his travel, not her danger.

 I'll write to my lord she's dead.   O Imogen,
Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!

        Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee
Were to prove false, which I will never be,
To him that is most true.   To Milford go,
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
You heavenly blessings, on her!   This fool's speed
Be cross'd with slowness; labor be his meed!
[Exit.  Sir, my life is yours;
I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,
I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
Nor when she purposes return.   Beseech your highness,
Hold me your loyal servant.

 I heard no letter from my master since
I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise
To yield me often tidings; neither know I
What is betid to Cloten; but remain
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.
These present wars shall find I love my country,
Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.
All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.    [Exit.  He hath been search'd among the dead and living,
But no trace of him.

                  It is my mistress:
Since she is living, let the time run on
To good or bad.
[Cymbeline and Imogen come forward.
 O, gentlemen, help!
Mine and your mistress!   O, my lord Posthumus!
You ne'er kill'd Imogen till now. Help, help!
Mine honor'd lady!

 Wake, my mistress!

 How fares my mistress?

 Lady,
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
That box I gave you was not thought by me
A precious thing: I had it from the queen.

 My lord,
Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
Upon my lady's missing, came to me
With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
It was my instant death. By accident,
I had a feigned letter of my master's
Then in my pocket; which directed him
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
Which he enforced from me, away he posts
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
My lady's honor: what became of him
I further know not.

"
269,cor.,CORNELIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-cor.," Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:
[Presenting a small box. 
But I beseech your grace, without offence,--
My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds,
Which are the movers of a languishing death;
But though slow, deadly?

 Your highness
Shall from this practice but make hard your heart:
Besides, the seeing these effects will be
Both noisome and infectious.

 I do suspect you, madam;
But you shall do no harm.

 I do not like her. She doth think she has
Strange lingering poisons: I do not know her spirit,
And will not trust one of her malice with
A drug of such damn'd nature.  Those she has
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
Which first, perchance, she'll prove on cats and dogs,
Then afterward up higher: but there is
No danger in what show of death it makes,
More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
With a most false effect; and I the truer,
So to be false with her.

 I humbly take my leave.
[Exit.
 Hail, great king!
To sour your happiness, I must report
The queen is dead.

 With horror, madly dying, like her life,
Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
I will report, so please you: these her women
Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
Were present when she finish'd.

 First, she confess'd she never loved you, only
Affected greatness got by you, not you:
Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
Abhorr'd your person.

 Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
With such integrity, she did confess
Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
But that her flight prevented it, she had
Ta'en off by poison.

 More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,
By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
O'ercome you with her show, and in time
When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
Her son into the adoption of the crown:
But, failing of her end by his strange absence,
Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite
Of heaven and men, her purposes, repented
The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so
Despairing died.

 O gods!
I left out one thing which the queen confess'd,
Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection
Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
As I would serve a rat.'

 The queen, sir, very oft importuned me
To temper poisons for her, still pretending
The satisfaction of her knowledge only
In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose
Was of more danger, did compound for her
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
The present power of life, but in short time
All offices of nature should again
Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?

 By the queen's dram she swallow'd.

I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
All parts of his subjection loyally.   For Cloten,
There wants no diligence in seeking him,
And will, no doubt, be found.

 So please your majesty,
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
Are landed on your coast, with a supply
Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.

Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,
Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,

More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
Of the divorce he'ld make!   The heavens hold firm

276,first-gent.,First Gentleman,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-first-gent.,"   He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
Although they wear their faces to the bent
Of the king's looks, hath a heart that is not
Glad at the thing they scowl at.
 He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
I mean, that married her, alack, good man
And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
As, to seek through the regions of the earth
For one his like, there would be something failing
In him that should compare.   I do not think
So fair an outward and such stuff within
Endows a man but he.

 I do extend him, sir, within himself,
Crush him together rather than unfold
His measure duly.

 I cannot delve him to the root: his father
Was called Sicilius, who did join his honour
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
But had his titles by Tenantius whom
He served with glory and admired success,
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
And had, besides this gentleman in question,
Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
As he was born. The king he takes the babe
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
A glass that feated them, and to the graver
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is.

 His only child.
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
Mark it: the eldest of them   at three years old,
I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
Which way they went.

 Some twenty years.

 Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,

To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
That our great king himself doth woo me oft
For my confections?   Having thus far proceeded,--
Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
That I did amplify my judgement in
Other conclusions? I will try the forces
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
To try the vigour of them and apply
Allayments to their act, and by them gather
Their several virtues and effects.

Until I send for thee.

 Weeps she still, say'st thou?   Dost thou think in time
She will not quench and let instructions enter
Where folly now possesses?   Do thou work:
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
As great as is thy master, greater, for
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor
Continue where he is: to shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another,
And every day that comes comes to decay
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
To be depender on a thing that leans,
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
So much as but to prop him?  [The Queen drops the box: Pisanio takes it up.] Thou takest up
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labor:
It is a thing I made, which hath the king
Five times redeem'd from   death: I do not know
What is more cordial.   Nay, I prithee, take it;
It is an earnest of a further good
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king
To any shape of thy preferment such
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
That set thee on to this desert, am bound
To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
Think on my words.
[Exit Pisanio.A sly and constant knave,
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master
And the remembrancer of her to hold
The hand-fast to her lord.   I have given him that
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured
To taste of too.

Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies.
So, so: well done, well done:
The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
Think on my words.
Exeunt Queen and Ladies.
 You are most bound to the king,
Who lets go by no vantages that may
Prefer you to his daughter.   Frame yourself
To orderly soliciting, and be friended
With aptness of the season; make denials
Increase your services; so seem as if
You were inspired to do those duties which
You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
Save when command to your dismission tends,
And therein you are senseless.

 And, to kill the marvel,
Shall be so ever.

  That opportunity
Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
The kings your ancestors, together with
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
With rocks unscaleable and roaring waters,
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
 Cæsar made here; but made not here his brag
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame:' with shame--
The first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--
Poor ignorant baubles!--on our terrible seas,
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--
 O giglot fortune!--to master Cæsar's sword,
Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
And Britons strut with courage.

 And you!

 He goes hence frowning: but it honors us
That we have given him cause.

 'Tis not sleepy business;
But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.

 Royal sir,
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,
Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
And strokes death to her.
Re-enter Attendant.
 My lord, when last I went to visit her,
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,
She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
Which daily she was bound to proffer: this
She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
Made me to blame in memory.

 Son, I say, follow the king.

 Go, look after.
[Exit Cloten.
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
It is a thing most precious. But for her,
Where is she gone?   Haply, despair hath seized her,
Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
To death or to dishonor; and my end
Can make good use of either: she being down,
I have the placing of the British crown.
Re-enter CLOTEN.
How now, my son!

 All the better: may
This night forestall him of the coming day!
[Exit.
"
281,imo.,IMOGEN,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-imo.," O
Dissembling courtesy!   How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds!   My dearest husband,
I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--
Always reserved my holy duty--what
His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
But that there is this jewel in the world
That I may see again.

 Nay, stay a little:
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
Such parting were too petty.   Look here, love;
This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;
But keep it till you woo another wife,
When Imogen is dead.

 O the gods!
When shall we see again?
Enter CYMBELINE and Lords.
 There cannot be a pinch in death
More sharp than this is.

 I beseech you, sir,
Harm not yourself with your vexation:
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
Subdues all pangs, all fears.

 Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.

 O blest, that I might not!   I chose an eagle,
And did avoid a puttock.

 No; I rather added
A lustre to it.

 Sir,
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
A man worth any woman, overbuys me
Almost the sum he pays.

 Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
Our neighbour shepherd's son!

 Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
I would they were in Afric both together;
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
The goer-back.   Why came you from your master?

 About some half-hour hence,
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
[Exeunt.  I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
And question'dst every sail: if he should write,
And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
That he spake to thee?

 Then waved his handkerchief?

 Senseless linen! happier therein than I!
And that was all?

 Thou shouldst have made him
As little as a crow, or less, ere left
To after-eye him.

 I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
To look upon him, till the diminution
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,
Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
When shall we hear from him?

 I did not take my leave of him, but had
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
How I would think on him at certain hours
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
The shes of Italy should not betray
Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at mid- night,
To encounter me with orisons, for then
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
Give him that parting kiss which I had set
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
Shakes all our buds from growing.
Enter a Lady.
 Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
I will attend the queen.

 A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
Vexations of it!   Had I been thief-stol'n,
As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,
How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO.
 Thanks, good sir:
You're kindly welcome.

 So far I read aloud:
But even the very middle of my heart
Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
In all that I can do.

 What makes your admiration?

 What is the matter, trow?

 What, dear sir,
Thus raps you? Are you well?

 Continues well my lord?   His health, beseech you?

 Is he disposed to mirth?   I hope he, is.

 When he was here,
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
Not knowing why.

 Will my lord say so?

 Not he, I hope,

 What do you pity, sir?

 Am I one, sir?
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
Deserves your pity?

 I pray you, sir,
Deliver with more openness your answers
To my demands. Why do you pity me?

 You do seem to know
Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--
Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
Than to be sure they do; for certainties
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
The remedy then born--discover to me
What both you spur and stop.

 My lord, I fear,
Has forgot Britain.

 Let me hear no more.

 Revenged!
How should I be revenged?   If this be true,--
As I have such a heart that both mine ears
Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
How should I be revenged?

 What, ho, Pisanio!

 Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
So long attended thee.   If thou wert honorable,
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange
Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
From thy report as thou from honor, and
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
The king my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
As in a Romish stew and to expound
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
He little cares for and a daughter who
He not respects at all.   What, ho, Pisanio!

 You make amends.

 All's well, sir: take my power i' the court for yours.

 Pray, what is't?

 Willingly;
And pawn mine honor for their safety: since
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
In my bedchamber.

 O, no, no.

 I thank you for your pains:
But not away to-morrow!

 I will write.
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
And truly yielded you.   You're very welcome.
Exeunt.  Who's there? my woman Helen?

 What hour is it?

 I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:
Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:
Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,
I prithee, call me.   Sleep hath seized me wholly.
[Exit Lady. 
To your protection I commend me, gods.
From fairies and the tempters of the night
Guard me, beseech ye.
[Sleeps. Iachimo comes from the trunk.
 Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
For purchasing but trouble: the thanks I give
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
And scarce can spare them.

 If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:
If you swear still, your recompense is still
That I regard it not.

 But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
I would not speak.   I pray you, spare me: 'faith,
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
To your best kindness: one of your great knowing
Should learn, being taught, forbearance.

 Fools are not mad folks.

 As I am mad, I do:
If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;
That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
You put me to forget a lady's manners,
By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,
That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
By the very truth of it, I care not for you,
And am so near the lack of charity--
To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather
You felt than make't my boast.

 Profane fellow!
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,
Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
Comparative for your virtues, to be styled
The under-hangman   of his kingdom, and hated
For being preferr'd so well.

 He never can meet more mischance than come
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,
That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!
Enter PISANIO.
 To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--

 I am sprited with a fool,
Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any king's in Europe. I do think
I saw't this morning: confident I am
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.

 I hope so: go and search.
[Exit Pisanio.
 Ay, I said so, sir:
If you will make't an action, call witness to't.

 Your mother too:
She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir.
To the worst of discontent.
[Exit.
 How now, Pisanio!

 Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!
O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
That knew the stars as I his characters;
He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,
Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:
Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
For it doth physic love: of his content,
All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
    [Reads]
O, for a horse with wings!   Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
May plod it in a week, why may not I
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--
Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--
O, let me bate,--but not like me--yet long'st,
But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;
For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;
Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
To the smothering of the sense--how far it is
To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
To inherit such a haven: but first of all,
How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:
Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
How many score of miles may we well ride
'Twixt hour and hour?

 Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
Could never go so slow: I have heard of riding wagers,
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
That run i' the clock's behalf.   But this is foolery:
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
She'll home to her father: and provide me presently
A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's housewife.

 I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say;
Accessible is none but Milford way.  [Exeunt. Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
To see me first, as I have now.   Pisanio! man!
Where is Posthumus?   What is in thy mind,
That makes thee stare thus?   Wherefore breaks that sigh
From the inward of thee?   One, but painted thus,
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
Beyond self-explication: put thyself
Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness
Vanquish my staider senses.   What's the matter?
Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with
A look untender?   If't be summer news,
Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st
But keep that countenance still.   My husband's hand!
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
May take off some extremity, which to read
Would be even mortal to me.

  False to his bed!   What is it to be false?
To lie in watch there and to think on him?
To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep charge nature,
To break it with a fearful dream of him
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?

 I false!  Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
Thy favor's good enough.   Some jay of Italy
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O
Men's vows are women's traitors!   All good seeming,
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
Put on for villany; not born where't grows,
But worn a bait for ladies.

 True honest men being heard, like false Æneas,
Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
From thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest:
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,
A little witness my obedience: look!
I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart:
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief:
Thy master is not there, who was indeed
The riches of it: do his bidding; strike.
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
But now thou seem'st a coward.

 Why, I must die;
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
No servant of thy master's.   Against self-slaughter
There is a prohibition so divine
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.
Something's afore't.   Soft, soft! we'll no defence;
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
All turn'd to heresy?   Away, away,
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
Believe false teachers: though those that are betray'd
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
Stands in worse case of woe.
And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
And make me put into contempt the suits
Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
It is no act of common passage, but
A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
That now thou tirest on, how the memory
Will then be pang'd by me.   Prithee, dispatch:
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
When I desire it too.

 Do't, and to bed then.

 Wherefore then
Didst undertake it?   Why hast thou abused
So many miles with a pretence? this place?
Mine action and thine own? our horses' labor?
The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
For my being absent? whereunto I never
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
The elected deer before thee?

 Talk thy tongue weary; speak:
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear,
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.

 Most like;
Bringing me here to kill me.

 Some Roman courtezan.

 Why, good fellow,
What shall I do the while? where bide? how live?
Or in my life what comfort, when I am
Dead to my husband?

 No court, no father; nor no more ado
With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
As fearful as a siege.

 Where then?
Hath Britain all the sun that shines?   Day, night,
Are they not in Britain?     I' the world's volume
Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;
In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think
There's livers out of Britain.

 O, for such means!
Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
I would adventure.

 Nay, be brief:
I see into thy end, and am almost
A man already.

 Thou art all the comfort
The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:
There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even
All that good time will give us: this attempt
I am soldier to, and will abide it with
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.

 Amen: I thank thee.
[Exeunt, severally. I see a man's life is a tedious one:
I have tired myself, and for two nights together
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
Where they should be relieved.   Two beggars told me
I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
A punishment or trial?   Yes; no wonder,
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
Is worse in kings than beggars.   My dear lord!
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,
My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
At point to sink for food. But what is this?
Here is a path to 't: 'tis some savage hold:
I were best not call; I dare not call: yet famine,
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,
Take or lend.   Ho!   No answer?   Then I'll enter.
Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy
But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.
Such a foe, good heavens! [Exit, to the cave.
Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.
 Good masters, harm me not:
Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought
To have begg'd or bought what I have took: good troth,
I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:
I would have left it on the board so soon
As I had made my meal, and parted
With prayers for the provider.

 I see you're angry:
Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
Have died had I not made it.

 To Milford-Haven.

 Fidele, sir.   I have a kinsman who
Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;
To whom   being going, almost spent with hunger,
I am fall'n in this offence.

 'Mongst friends,
If brothers.   [Aside]
Would it had been so, that they
Had been my father's sons! then had my prize
Been less, and so more equal ballasting
To thee, Posthumus.

 Great men,
That had a court no bigger than this cave,
That did attend themselves and had the virtue
Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by
That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--
Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
I'ld change my sex to be companion with them,
Since Leonatus's false.

 Thanks, sir.

 So man and man should be;
But clay and clay differs in dignity,
Whose dust is both alike.   I am very sick.

 So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
But not so citizen a wanton as
To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;
Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
To one not sociable: I am not very sick,
Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:
I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,
Stealing so poorly.

 I wish ye sport.

 These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have heard!
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:
Experience, O, thou disprovest report!
The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,
I'll now taste of thy drug.  [Swallows some.
 Well or ill,
I am bound to you.

 Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is the way?--
I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?
'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--
I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
But, soft! no bedfellow!--O gods and goddesses!  [Seeing the body of Cloten. 
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
This bloody man, the care on't.   I hope I dream;
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes
Are sometimes like our judgements, blind. Good faith,
I tremble still with fear: but if there be
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is
Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.
A headless man!   The garments of Posthumus!
I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;
His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face--
Murder in heaven?--Hoy!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
Hast here cut off my lord.   To write and read
Be henceforth treacherous!   Damn'd Pisanio
Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--
From this most bravest vessel of the world
Struck the main-top!   O Posthumus! alas,
Where is thy head? where's that?   Ay me! where's that?
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them
Have laid this woe here.   O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
And cordial to me, have I not found it
Murderous to the senses?   That confirms it home:
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!
Give color to my pale cheek with thy blood,
That we the horrider may seem to those
Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!
[Falls on the body. 
Enter Lucius, a Captain and other Officers, and a Soothsayer. 
 I am nothing: or if not,
Nothing to be were better.   This was my master,
A very valiant Briton and a good,
That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
There is no more such masters: I may wander
From east to occident, cry out for service,
Try many, all good, serve truly, never
Find such another master.

 Richard du Champ.   [Aside] If I do
lie and do
No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?

 Fidele, sir.

 I'll follow, sir.  But first, an't please the gods,
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave.
And on it said a century of prayers,
Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
And leaving so his service, follow you,
So please you entertain me.

 I humbly thank your highness.

 No, no: alack,
There's other work in hand: I see a thing
Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,
Must shuffle for itself.

 He is a Roman; no more kin to me
Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,
Am something nearer.

 I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
To give me hearing.

 Fidele, sir.

 My boon is, that this gentleman may render
Of whom he had this ring.

 Peace, my lord; hear, hear--

 O, get thee from my sight;
Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!
Breathe not where princes are.

                     It poison'd me.

 Most like I did, for I was dead.

 Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
Think that you are upon a rock; and now
Throw me again.  [Embracing him.
 Your blessing, sir.
 I am sorry for 't, my lord.

 That headless man
I thought had been my lord.

 No, my lord;
I have got two worlds by't.   O my gentle brothers,
Have we thus met?   O, never say hereafter
But I am truest speaker: you call'd me brother,
When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
When ye were so indeed.

 You are my father too, and did relieve me,
To see this gracious season.

 My good master,
I will yet do you service.

 Almost midnight, madam.

"
283,first-sen.,First Senator,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-first-sen.," This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:
That since the common men are now in action
'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
And that the legions now in Gallia are
Full weak to undertake our wars against
The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
The gentry to this business. He creates
Lucius proconsul: and to you the tribunes,
For this immediate levy, he commends
 His absolute commission. Long live Cæsar!

 With those legions
Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
Must be supplyant: the words of your commission
Will tie you to the numbers and the time
Of their dispatch.

"
284,sec.-sen.,Second Senator,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-sec.-sen.," Ay.

"
285,first-tri.,First Tribune,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-first-tri.," Is Lucius general of the forces?

 Remaining now in Gallia?

 We will discharge our duty.

The one is Caius Lucius.

287,atten.,Attendant,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-atten.," Please you, sir,
Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer
That will be given to the loudest noise we make.

"
289,lord.,a British Lord,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-lord.," Camest thou from where they made the stand!

 I did.

 Where was this lane?

 This was strange chance:
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.

 Nay, be not angry, sir.

 Farewell; you're angry.

"
291,first-lady.,First Lady,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-first-lady.," I, madam.

 We did, so please your highness.

"
292,lady.,a Lady,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-lady.," The queen, madam,
Desires your highness' company.

 Who's there that knocks?

 No more?

 That's more
Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?

 Ay,
To keep her chamber.

 How! my good name? or to report of you
What I shall think is good?--The princess!
Enter IMOGEN.
"
295,sici.,SICILIUS LEONATUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-sici.," No more, thou thunder-master, show
 Thy spite on mortal flies:
With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
 That thy adulteries
 Rates and revenges.
Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
Whose face I never saw?
I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
 Attending nature's law:
Whose father then, as men report
 Thou orphans' father art,
Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
From this earth-vexing smart.

 Great nature, like his ancestry,
 Moulded the stuff so fair,
That he deserved the praise o' the world,
As great Sicilius' heir.

 Why did you suffer Iachimo,
 Slight thing of Italy,
To taint his nobler heart and brain
 With needless jealousy:
And to become the geck and scorn
 O' th' other's villany?

 Thy crystal window ope; look out;
 No longer exercise
Upon a valiant race thy harsh
 And potent injuries.

 Peep through thy marble mansion; help;
Or we poor ghosts will cry
To the shining synod of the rest
Against thy deity.

 He came in thunder; his celestial breath
Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle
Stoop'd, as to foot us: his ascension is
More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird
Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
As when his god is pleased.

 The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd
His radiant roof.   Away! and, to be blest,
Let us with care perform his great behest.
[The Ghosts vanish.
"
296,moth.,his wife,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-moth.," Lucina lent not me her aid,
 But took me in my throes:
That from me was Posthumus ript,
Came crying 'mongst his foes,
  A thing of pity!

 With marriage wherefore was he  mock'd,
To be exiled, and thrown
From Leonati seat, and cast
From her his dearest one,
Sweet Imogen?

 Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
Take off his miseries.

"
300,jup.,Jupiter,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-jup.," No more, you petty spirits of region low,
Offend our hearing; hush!   How dare you ghosts
Accuse the thunder, whose bolt, you know,
 Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
 Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:
Be not with mortal accidents opprest;
 No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.
Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
 The more delay'd, delighted.   Be content;
Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:
 His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in
 Our temple was he married.   Rise, and fade,
He shall be lord of lady Imogen,
 And happier much by his affliction made.
This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
 Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:
And so, away: no further with your din
 Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
 Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.

"
302,cor-6,CAIUS MARCIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-6," Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?

 He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring.   What would you have, you curs,
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down oaks with rushes.   Hang ye!   Trust ye?
With every minute you do change a mind,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland.   What's the matter,
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one another?   What's their seeking ?

 Hang 'em!   They say!
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
Who thrives and who declines; side factions and give out
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
And let me use my sword, I'ld make a quarry
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
As I could pick my lance.

 They are dissolved: hang 'em!
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
And a petition granted them, a strange one—
To break the heart of generosity,
And make bold power look pale—they threw their caps
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
Shouting their emulation.

 Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not—'Sdeath!
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
For insurrection's arguing.

 Go, get you home, you fragments!
Enter a Messenger, hastily.
 Here: what's the matter?

 I am glad on't: then we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other
Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS
VELUTUS.
 They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I any thing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

 Were half to half the world by the ears and he
Upon my party, I'ld revolt, to make
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.

 Sir, it is;
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?

 Nay, let them follow:
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.

Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus.
 Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.

 'Tis done.

 Say, has our general met the enemy?

 I'll buy him of you.

 How far off lie these armies?

 Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
They sound a parley.   Enter two Senators
with others on the walls.
Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

 O, they are at it!

 They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sweat with wrath.   Come on, my fellows:
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
And he shall feel mine edge.
Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches.
 Re-enter MARCIUS, cursing.
 All the contagion of the south light on you,
You shames of Rome? you herd of—Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Further than seen and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With fright and agued fear!   Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on:
If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches followed.

Another alarum.   The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows them to the gates.
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

Enters the gates.
 See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd   drachma!   Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.

 Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.

 Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.

 Come I too late?

 Come I too late?

 O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward!

 As with a man busied about decrees:
Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him slip at will.

 Let him alone;
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
The common file—a plague! tribunes for them! —
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
From rascals worse than they.

 Will the time serve to tell?   I do not think.
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?

 How lies their battle? know you on which side
They have placed their men of trust?

 I do beseech you,
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
We have made to endure friends, that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you not delay the present, but,
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
We prove this very hour.

 Those are they
That most are willing: If any such be here—
As it were sin to doubt—that love this painting
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country's dearer than himself;
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius.

They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps.
O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? none of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
Though thanks to all, must I select from all: the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
As cause will be obey'd.   Please you to march;
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclined.

 I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.

 Let the first budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom him after!

  Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to the highest.

  Pray now, no more: my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
As you have done; that's what I can; induced
As you have been; that's for my country:
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.

 I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
To hear themselves remember'd.

 I thank you, general;
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
And stand upon my common part with those
That have beheld the doing.

A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!' cast up their caps and lances: Cominius and Lartius stand bare.
 May these same instruments, which you profane,
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
Made all of false-faced soothing!
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
No more, I say!   For that I have not wash'd
My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch,—
Which, without note, here's many else have done,—
You shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical;
As if I loved my little should be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.

 I will go wash;
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power.

 The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my lord general.

 I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
To give my poor host freedom.

 By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

 No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more.

 O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity!Kneels.
 My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That weep'st to see me triumph?   Ah, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.

 And live you yet? To Valeria
O my sweet lady, pardon.

 Menenius ever, ever.

 Your hand, and yours:
Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
The good patricians must be visited;
From whom I have received not only greetings,
But with them change of honours.

 Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way
Than sway with them in theirs.

 Your honours' pardon:
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.

 No, sir: yet oft,
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but your people,
I love them as they weigh.

 I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.
Exit.
 I do owe them still
My life and services.

 I do beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
That I may pass this doing.

 It is a part
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people.

 To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had received them for the hire
Of their breath only!

 What must I say?
'I pray, sir,'—Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace:—'Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service, when
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
From the noise of our own drums.'

 Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.

 Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean. Re-enter two of the Citizens.
So, here comes a brace.

Re-enter a third Citizen.
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.

           Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
Their needless vouches?   Custom calls me to 't:
What custom wills, in all things should we do 't,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do this.   I am   half through;
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
         Re-enter three Citizens more.
Here come more voices.
Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
Done many things, some less, some more: your voices:
Indeed, I would be consul.

  Is this done?

 Where? at the senate-house?

 May I change these garments?

 That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.

 Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

 So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
Upon's again.

 Saw you Aufidius?

 Spoke he of me?

 How? what?

 At Antium lives he?

 I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
For they do prank them in authority,
Against all noble sufferance.

 Ha! what is that?

 What makes this change?

  Have I had children's voices?

 Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues?   What are your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?

 It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will of the nobility:
Suffer 't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled.

 Why, this was known before.

 Have you inform'd them sithence?

 Why then should I be consul?   By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow tribune.

 Tell me of corn
This was my speech, and I will speak 't again—

 Now, as I live, I will.   My nobler friends,
I crave their pardons:
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Which they have given to beggars.

 How! no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them.

 Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove! 'twould be my mind!

 Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

 'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power,
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you.   You are plebeians,
If they be senators: and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench
Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.

 Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,—

 Though there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

 I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
They ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war.
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Which they have often made against the senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate's courtesy?   Let deeds express
What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.

 No, take more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance,—it must omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, it follows,
Nothing is done to purpose.   Therefore, beseech you,—
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Mangles true judgement and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For the ill which doth control't.

 Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes ?
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
When what's not meet, but what must be was law,
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
And throw their power i' the dust.

 Hence, old goat! Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments.

 No, I'll die here.

Drawing his sword.
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

 I would they were barbarians—as they are,
Though in Rome litter'd—not Romans—as they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol—

 On fair ground
I could beat forty of them.

 Let them pull all about mine ears, present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them.

 I muse my mother
Does not approve me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vassals, things created
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war.
Enter VOLUMNIA.
I talk of you:
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
False to my nature? Rather say I play
The man I am.

 Let go.

 Let them hang.

 What must I do?

 Well, what then? what then?

 For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

 Tush, tush!

 Why force you this?

 Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
And throw 't against the wind. To the marketplace!
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to the life.

 Well, I must do't:
Away, my disposition, and possess me
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.

 Pray, be content:
Mother, I am going to the market-place;
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I' the way of flattery further.

 The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Will answer in mine honour.

 Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
Exeunt.
 Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by the volume.   The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
Supplied   with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
And not our streets with war!

 First, hear me speak.

 Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?

 I am content.

 Scratches with briers,
Scars to move laughter only.

 What is the matter
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
You take it off again?

 Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

 How! traitor!

 The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
In thy hands clutch'd as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray the gods.

 What do you prate of service?

 You?

 I'll know no further:
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
Nor check my courage for what they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

 You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despair!   Have the power still
To banish your defenders; till at length
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows! Despising,
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
There is a world elsewhere.

Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, Menenius, Senators, and Patricians.

 Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient courage? you were used
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
That common chances common men could bear;
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that conn'd them.

 Nay, I prithee, woman,—

 What, what, what!
I shall be loved when I am   lack'd.   Nay, mother,
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his labours you 'ld have done, and saved
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop not; adieu.   Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
My hazards still have been your solace: and
Believe 't not lightly—though I go alone,
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen—your son
Will or exceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practice.

 O the gods!

 Fare ye well:
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
While I remain above the ground, you shall
Hear from me still, and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly.

 Give me thy hand:
Come.

Exeunt.
 A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay me.
Enter a Citizen.
Save you, sir.

 Direct me, if it be your will,
Where great Aufidius lies; is he in Antium?

 Which is his house, beseech you?

 Thank you, sir: farewell.

Exit Citizen.
O world, thy slippery turns!   Friends now fast sworn,
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
On a dissension of a doit, break out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
To take the one the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
He does fair justice; if he give me way,
I'll do his country service.
Exit.
 A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear not like a guest.

Re-enter the first Servingman.
 I have deserved no better entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.
Re-enter second Servingman.
            If, Tullus,                  Unmuffling. 
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself.

 A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.

 Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st thou me yet?

 My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope—
Mistake me not—to save my life, for if
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight,
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou durst not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou 'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

 You bless me, gods!

 What's the matter?

 Away!

 Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Are servanted to others: though I owe
My revenge properly, my remission lies
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake,

Gives a letter.
And would have sent it.   Another word, Menenius,
I will not hear thee speak.   This man, Aufidius,
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!

 We will before the walls of Rome to-morrow
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
I have borne this business.

 This last old man,
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Loved me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
The first conditions, which they did refuse
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That thought he could do more, a very little
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shout within.
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time 'tis made?   I will not.

Enter, in mourning habits, VIRGILIA,
VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants.
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stronger earth than others.   My mother bows;
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod: and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession, which
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
Plough Rome, and harrow Italy: I'll never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
As if a man were author of himself
And knew no other kin.

 These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

 Like a dull actor now,
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;

Kneels.
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons.

 What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot be, slight work.

 The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdled by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

 The god of soldiers,
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
And saving those that eye thee!

 That's my brave boy!

 I beseech you, peace:
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by your denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
To allay my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

 Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from   Rome in private.   Your request?

 Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat too long.
Rising.
 O mother, mother!
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for your son,—believe it, O, believe it,
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
If not most mortal to him. But, let come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?

 I dare be sworn you were:
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

 Ay, by and by;

To Volumnia, Virgilia, &c.
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A better witness back than words, which we,
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you: all the swords
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
Could not have made this peace.
Exeunt. 
 Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my country's love
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
Under your great command. You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the action.  We have made peace
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Together with the seal o' the senate, what
We have compounded on.

 Traitor! how now!

 Marcius!

 Hear'st thou, Mars?

 Ha!

 Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
I was forced to scold. Your judgements, my grave lords,
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion—
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave—shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

 Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I did it. Boy!

 O that I had him,
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
To use my lawful sword!

"
303,cor-15,Titus Lartius,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-15," My horse to yours, no.

 Agreed.

 So, the good horse is mine.

 No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.

 Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
Enter the army of the Volsces.
 What is become of Marcius? O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
Thou madest thine enemies shake, as if the world
Were feverous and did tremble.

Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy.
 O, 'tis Marcius!
Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

They fight, and all enter the city.
 Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
Thy exercise hath been too violent
For a second course of fight.

 Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
Prosperity be thy page!

 Thou worthiest Marcius!

Exit Marcius,
Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
Call thither all the officers o' the town,
Where they shall know our mind: away!

Exeunt.
 So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve
For a short holding: if we lose the field,
We cannot keep the town.

 Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.
Exeunt. 
 O general,
Here is the steed, we the caparison:
Hadst thou beheld—

 I shall, my lord.

 Marcius, his name?

 He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
Our swifter composition.

 On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.

 He did, my lord.

 How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution, so he might
Be call'd your vanquisher.

 At Antium.

"
304,cor-8,Cominius,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-8," You have fought together.

 It is your former promise.

 Noble Marcius!

 Breathe you, my friends: well fought; we are come off
Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes as we wish our own,
That both our powers, with smiling fronts encountering,
May give you thankful sacrifice.
Enter a Messenger.
Thy news?

 Though thou speak'st truth,
Methinks thou speak'st not well.   How long is 't since?

 'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
And bring thy news so late?

 Who's yonder,
That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods!
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seen him thus.

 The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man.
Enter MARCIUS.
 Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
But mantled in your own.

 Flower of warriors,
How is't with Titus Lartius?

 Where is that slave
Which told me that they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? call him hither.

 But how prevail'd you?

 Marcius,
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our purpose.

 As I guess, Marcius,
Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
Their very heart of hope.

 Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
That best can aid your action.

 March on, my fellows:
Make good this ostentation, and you shall
Divide in all with us.
Exeunt.
 If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
And, glady quaked, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
Having fully dined before.

Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit.
 You shall not be
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
To hide your doings; and to silence that,
Which, to   the spire and   top   of praises vouch'd
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you—
In sign of what you are, not to reward
What you have done—before our army hear me.

 Should they not,
Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
The treasure in this field achieved and city,
We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
Before the common distribution, at
Your only choice.

 Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly: by your patience,
If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
For what he did before Corioli, call him,
With all applause and clamour of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
The addition nobly ever!

Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums.
 So, to our tent;
Where, ere we do repose, we will write
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
The best, with whom we may articulate,
For their own good and ours.

  Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?

 O, well begg'd!
Were he the butcher of my son, he should
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

 Go we to our tent:
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should be look'd to: come.
Exeunt.
 Look, sir, your mother!

 Ever right.

 On, to the Capitol!

Flourish.   Cornets.
 Exeunt in state, as before. Brutus and Sicinius come forward.
 I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him: he bestrid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
He lurch'd all swords of the garland.   For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say,
I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with sudden re-inforcement struck
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
Both field and city ours, he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.

 Our spoils he kick'd at,
And look'd upon things precious as they were
The common muck of the world: he covets less
Than misery itself would give; rewards
His deeds with doing them, and is content
To spend the time to end it.

  They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again.

 Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

 You are like to do such business.

 The people are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' the plain way of his merit.

 'Twas from the canon.

 Well, on to the market-place.

 Aged sir, hands off.

 That is the way to lay the city flat;
To bring the roof to the foundation,
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
In heaps and piles of ruin.

 Stand fast;
We have as many friends as enemies.

 Come, sir, along with us.

 But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are used to bear.

 Nay, come away.

Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, and others.
 I have been i' the market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit,
You make strong party, or defend yourself
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

 I think 'twill serve, if he
Can thereto frame his spirit.

 Come, come, we'll prompt you.

 Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
To answer mildly; for they are prepared
With accusations, as I hear, more strong
Than are upon you yet.

 Well, well, no more.

 Know, I pray you,—

 Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,—

 Let me speak:
I have been consul, and can show for Rome
Her enemies' marks upon me.   I do love
My country's good with a respect more tender,
More holy and profound, than mine own life,
My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
And treasure of my loins; then if I would
Speak that,—

 I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
I' the absence of the needer.

 O, you have made good work?

 You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,—

 Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an auger's bore.

 If!
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than nature,
That shapes men better; and they follow him,
Against us brats, with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.

 He will shake
Your Rome about your ears.

 Ay; and you'll look pale
Before you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
Your enemies and his find something in him.

 Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As those should do that had deserved his hate
And therein show'd like enemies.

 You have brought
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
So incapable of help.

 But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer: desperation
Is all the policy, strength and defence,
That Rome can make against them.
Enter a troop of Citizens.
 Ye're goodly things, you voices!

 O, ay, what else?

Exeunt Cominius and Menenius.
 He would not seem to know me.

 Yet one time did he call me by my name:
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
That we have bled together. Coriolanus
He would not answer to; forbad all names;
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
Of burning Rome.

 I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less expected: he replied,
It was a bare petition of a state
To one whom they had punish'd.

 I offer'd to awaken his regard
For 's private friends: his answer to me was,
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
And still to nose the offence.

 He'll never hear him.

 I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus, with his speechless hand; what he would do,
He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
So that all hope is vain,
Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
For mercy to his country.   Therefore, let's hence,
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

Exeunt.
"
305,cor-20,Menenius Agrippa,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-20," What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
With bats and clubs?   The matter? speak, I pray you.

 Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbors,
Will you undo yourselves?

 I tell you, friends, most charitable care
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state, whose course will on
The way it takes, crackling ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you, and you slander
The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
When you curse them as enemies.

 Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
To stale't a little more.

 There was a time when all the body's members
Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
That only like a gulf it did remain
I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
And, mutually participate, did minister
Unto the appetite and affection common
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd—

 Sir, I shall tell you.   With a kind of smile,
Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus,—
For, look you, I may make the belly smile
As well as speak—it tauntingly replied
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you.

 What then?
'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?

 Well, what then?

 I will tell you;
If you'll bestow a small—of what you have little—
Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.

 Note me this, good friend;
Your most grave belly was deliberate,
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
'That I receive the general food at first,
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
Because I am the store-house and the shop
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
I send it through the rivers of your blood,
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
You, my good friends,'—this says the belly, mark me,—

 'Though all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each,
Yet I can make my audit up, that all
From me do back receive the flour of all,
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to 't?

 The senators of Rome are this good belly,
And you the mutinous members; for examine
Their counsels and their cares: digest things rightly
Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
You, the great toe of this assembly?

 For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
Lead'st first to win some vantage.
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
The one side must have bale.
Enter CAIUS MARCIUS.
Hail, noble Marcius.

 For corn at their own rates; whereof they say,
The city is well stored.

 Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
For though abundantly they lack discretion,
Yet are they passing cowardly.   But, I beseech you,
What says the other troop?

 What is granted them?

 This is strange.

 O, true-bred!

                  A letter for me!   it gives me an estate
of seven years' health; in which time I
will make a lip at the physician: the most
sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic,
and, to this preservative, of no better
report than a horse-drench. Is he not
wounded? he was wont to come home
wounded.

        Now, the gods crown thee!

 A hundred thousand welcomes.   I could weep
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy.
Welcome.
A curse begin at very root on's heart,
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
We have some old crab-trees here at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
We call a nettle but a nettle and
The faults of fools but folly.

 Having determined of the Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
As the main point of this our after-meeting,
To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country: therefore, please you
Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
The present consul, and last general
In our well-found successes, to report
A little of that worthy work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
We met here both to thank and to remember
With honours like himself.

 That's off, that's off;
I would you rather had been silent. Please you
To hear Cominius speak?

 He loves your people;
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius, speak.   Coriolanus offers to go away.
Nay, keep your place.

 Pray now, sit down.

 Masters of the people,
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter—
That's thousand to one good one—when you now see
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than one on's ears to hear it?   Proceed, Cominius.

 Worthy man!

 He's right noble:
Let him be call'd for.

 The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
To make thee consul.

 It then remains
That you do speak to the people.

 Put them not to 't:
Pray you, go fit you to the customs and
Take to you, as your predecessors have,
Your honour with your form.

 Do not stand upon 't.
We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour.

 O sir, you are not right: have you not known
The worthiest men have done't?

 O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that: you must desire them
To think upon you.

 You'll mar all:
I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
In wholesome manner.
Exit.

 You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice: remains
That, in the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.

 I'll keep you company.   Will you along ?

 The matter?

 Be calm, be calm.

 Let's be calm.

 Not now, not now.

 Well, no more.

 What, what? his choler?

 Well, well, no more of that.

 Come, enough.

 On both sides more respect.

 What is about to be?   I am out of breath;
Confusion's near; I cannot speak.   You, tribunes
To the people!   Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.

 Fie, fie, fie!
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

 And so are like to do.

 Hear me one word;
Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.

   Be that you seem, truly your country's friend,
And temperately proceed to what you would
Thus violently redress.

 Down with that sword!   Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

 Help Marcius, help,
You that be noble; help him, young and old!

 Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.

 Shall it be put to that?

 For 'tis a sore upon us,
You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.

 Be gone;
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
One time will owe another.

 I could myself
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the two tribunes.

 Pray you, be gone:
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
With cloth of any colour.

 His nature is too noble for the world:
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
And, being angry, does forget that ever
He heard the name of death.A noise within.
Here's goodly work!

 I would they were in Tiber!   What the vengeance!
Could he not speak 'em fair?

Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble.
 You worthy tribunes,—

 Sir, sir,—

 Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
With modest warrant.

 Hear me speak:
As I do know the consul's worthiness,
So can I name his faults,—

 The consul Coriolanus.

 If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
The which shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much loss of time.

 Now the good gods forbid
That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
Should now eat up her own!

 O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost—
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
By many an ounce—he dropp'd it for his country;
And what is left, to lose it by his country,
Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
A brand to the end o' the world.

 The service of the foot
Being once gangrened, is not then respected
For what before it was.

 One word more, one word.
This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
And sack great Rome with Romans.

 Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
In bolted language; meal and bran together
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
In peace, to his utmost peril.

 I'll bring him to you.
To the Senators
Let me desire your company: he must come,
Or what is worst will follow.

 Come, come, you   have been too rough, something too rough;
You must return and mend it.

 Well said, noble woman!
Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on.
Which I can scarcely bear.

 Return to the tribunes.

 Repent what you have spoke.

 A good demand.

 Noble lady!
Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
Of what is past.

 This but done,
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
As words to little purpose.

 Only fair speech.

 Ay, but mildly.

 Calmly, I do beseech you.

 A noble wish.

  Re-enter Ædile, with Citizens.
 Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
The warlike service he has done, consider; think
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.

 Consider further,
That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier: do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
Rather than envy you.

  Nay, temperately; your promise.

 Is this the promise that you made your mother?

 That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
If I could shake off but one seven years
From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
I'ld with thee every foot.

 Peace, peace; be not so loud.

 Come, come, peace.

 You have told them home;
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?

 Fie, fie, fie!
Exeunt.
 Hail to you both!

 All's well; and might have been much better, if
He could have temporized.

 Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Hear nothing from him.
Enter three or four Citizens.
 I think not so.

 'Tis Aufidius,
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
And durst not once peep out.

 Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
And three examples of the like have been
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
Before you punish him, where he heard this,
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded.

 This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.
Enter a second Messenger.
 What news? what news?

 What 's the news? what 's the news?

 Pray now, your news?
You have made fair work, I fear me.—Pray, your news?—
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,—

 You have made good work,
You and your apron-men; you that stood so much
Upon the voice of occupation and
The breath of garlic-eaters!

 As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit. You have made fair work!

 We are undone, unless
The noble man have mercy.

 'Tis true:
If he were putting to my house the brand
That should consume it, I have not the face
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!

 How!  Was it we? we loved him; but, like beasts
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
Who did hoot him out o' the city.

 Here come the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him?   You are they
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
If he could burn us all into one coal,
We have deserved it.

 You have made
Good work, you and your cry Shall's to the Capitol ?

 No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
Which was sometime his general; who loved him
In a most dear particular.   He call'd me father:
But what o' that?   Go, you that banish'd him;
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
To hear Cominous speak, I'll keep at home.

 Do you hear?

 Why, so: you have made good work!
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
To make coals cheap,—a noble memory!

 Very well:
Could he say less?

 For one poor grain or two!
I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.

 No, I'll not meddle.

 What should I do?

 Well, and say that Marcius
Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
Unheard; what then?
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
With his unkindness? say't be so?

 I'll undertake 't:
I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
He was not taken well; he had not dined:
The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
We pout upon the morning, are unapt
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
Till he be dieted to my request,
And then I'll set upon him.

  Good faith, I'll prove him, 60
Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
Of my success.
Exit.
 You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
I am an officer of state, and come
To speak with Coriolanus.

 From Rome.

 Good my friends,
If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
My name hath touch'd your ears: it is Menenius.

 I tell thee, fellow,
Thy general is my lover: I have been
The book of his good acts, whence men have read
His fame unparallel'd, haply amplified;
For I have ever verified my friends,
Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
I must have leave to pass.

  Hath he dined, canst thou tell? for
I would not speak with him till after dinner.

 I am, as thy general is.

     How! away!

        This is good news:
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
I'ld not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
Music still, with shouts. 
"
306,cor-31,Sicinius Velutus,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-31," Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

 When we were chosen tribunes for the people,—

 Nay, but his taunts.

 Be-mock the modest moon.

 Such a nature,
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.

 Besides, if things go well,
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius.

 Let's hence, and hear
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
More than his singularity, he goes
Upon this present action.

 Nature teaches beasts to know their
friends.

    On the sudden,
I warrant him consul.

 He cannot temperately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won.

 Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours, which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do 't.

 'Tis right.

 I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution.

 It shall be to him then as our good wills,
A sure destruction.

 This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people—which time shall not want,
If he be put upon't; and that's as easy
As to set dogs on sheep—will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.
              Enter a Messenger.
 Have with you.
Exeunt.
 We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme to our assembly.

 Sir, the people
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony.

 May they perceive's intent!   He will require them,
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give.

 The custom of request you have discharged:
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.

 There, Coriolanus.

 You may, sir.

 Fare you well.

Exeunt Coriolanus and Menenius.
He has it now, and by his looks methinks
'Tis warm at's heart.

 How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

 Why, so he did, I am sure.

 Why either were you ignorant to see 't,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?

 Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to;
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.

 Have you
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?

 Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgement all revoke
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
The apprehension of his present portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you.

 Say, you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Pre-occupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

 One thus descended,
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrances: but you have found,
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbation.

 To the Capitol, come:
We will be there before the stream o' the people;
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we have goaded onward.
Exeunt.
 Pass no further.

 Stop,
Or all will fall in broil.

 You show too much of that
For which the people stir: if you will pass
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Nor yoke with him for tribune.

 'Twere well
We let the people know't.

 It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.

 Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
As traitors do.

 This a consul? no.

 Go, call the people: Exit Ædile in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
And follow to thine answer.

 Help, ye citizens!

  Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with  the Ædiles.
 Here's he that would take from you all your power.

   Hear me, people; peace!

 You are at point to lose your liberties:
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
Whom late you have named for consul.

 What is the city but the people?

 This deserves death.

 Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
Into destruction cast him.

   Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?

 He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power
Which he so sets at nought.

 Peace!

 Sir, how comes't that you
Have holp to make this rescue?

 Consul! what consul?

 Speak briefly then;
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
Were but one danger, and to keep him here
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
He dies to-night.

 He's a disease that must be cut away.

 This is clean kam.

 What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
  Our ædiles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.

 Noble Menenius,
Be you then as the people's officer.
Masters, lay down your weapons.

 Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
In our first way,

 Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down by the poll?

   Have you collected them by tribes?

   Assemble presently the people hither;
And when they hear me say 'It shall be so
I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i' the truth o' the cause.

   Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
When we shall hap to give 't them.

 Well, here he comes.

Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS, with Senators and Patricians. 
 Draw near, ye people.

   I do demand,
If you submit you to the people's voices,
Allow their officers and are content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
As shall be proved upon you?

 Answer to us.

 We charge you, that you have contrived to take
From Rome all season'd office and to wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which you are a traitor to the people.

 Mark you this, people?

 Peace!
We need not put new matter to his charge:
What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
Those whose great power must try him; even this,
So criminal and in such capital kind,
Deserves the extremest death.

 For that he has,
As much as in him lies, from time to time
Envied against the people, seeking means
To pluck away their power, as now at last
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
Even from this instant, banish him our city,
In peril of precipitation
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
I say it shall be so.

 He's sentenced; no more hearing.

 We know your drift: speak what?

 Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
As he hath follow'd you, with all despite;
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
Attend us through the city.

 Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
In his behalf.

 Bid them home:
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
Stand in their ancient strength.

 Let's not meet her.

 They say she's mad.

 Are you mankind?

 O blessed heavens!

 What then?

 I would he had continued to his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The noble knot he made.

 Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits?

 We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
And quietness of the people, which before
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
Though they themselves did suffer by 't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going
About their functions friendly.

 'Tis he, 'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.

 Your Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
Were he more angry at it.

 Where is he, hear you?

 God-den, our neighbours.

 Live, and thrive!

 This is a happier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
Crying confusion.

  And affecting one sole throne,
Without assistance.

 We should by this, to all our lamentation,
If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

 Come, what talk you
Of Marcius?

 Tell not me:
I know this cannot be.

 'Tis this slave;—
Go whip him 'fore the people's eyes:—his raising;
Nothing but his report.

 What more fearful?

 This is most likely!

 The very trick on 't.

 Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show no sign of fear.

 Nor I.

 Pray, let us go.

Exeunt.
 Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
In this so never-needed help, yet do not
Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
More than the instant army we can make,
Might stop our countryman.

 Pray you, go to him.

 Yet your good will
Must have that thanks from   Rome, after the measure
As you intended well.

 Not?

      What's the news?

 Friend,
Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?

 First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
Accept my thankfulness.

 They are near the city?

 We will meet them,
And help the joy.
Exeunt.
"
307,cor-13,Junius Brutus,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-13," He has no equal.

 Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

 Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods—

 The present wars devour him: he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.

 Fame, at the which he aims,
In whom already he's well graced, can not
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O, if he
Had borne the business!'

 Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius,
Though Marcius earn'd them not, and all his faults
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
In aught he merit not.

 Let's along.
Exeunt.
         All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station: our veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture.

 Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep.

 In that there's comfort.

 I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor, showing, as the manner is, his wounds
To the people, beg their stinking breaths.

 It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
And the desire of the nobles.

 'Tis most like he will.

 So it must fall out
To him or our authorities. For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
In human action and capacity,
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in the war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

 What's the matter?

 Let's to the Capitol;
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
But hearts for the event.

 Which the rather
We shall be blest to do, if he remember
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto prized them at.

 Most willingly;
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it.

 Sir, I hope
My words disbench'd you not.

 Mark you that?

 You see how he intends to use the people.

 Come, we'll inform them
Of our proceedings here: on the market-place,
I know, they do attend us.
Exeunt.
 We stay here for the people.

 With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
Will you dismiss the people?
Re-enter Citizens.
 We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

 Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Be curses, to yourselves?   You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.

 Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves, and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
When he hath power to crush?   Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgement?

 Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties: make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.

 Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we labour'd,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.

 Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you,
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our best water brought by conduits hither;
And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,
Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,
Was his great ancestor.

 Say, you ne'er had done 't—
Harp on that still—but by our putting on:
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to the Capitol. Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.

 It will be dangerous to go on: no further.

 Cominius, no.

 The people are incensed against him.

 Call't not a plot:
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

 Not to them all.

 How! I inform them!

 Not unlike,
Each way, to better yours.

 You speak o' the people,
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity.

 Why, shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?

 Enough, with over-measure.

 Has said enough.

 Manifest treason!

 The ædiles, ho!
    Enter an Ædile.
Let him be apprehended,

   Seize him, ædiles!

 By the consent of all, we were establish'd
The people's magistrates.

 Or let us stand to our authority,
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
Of present death.

 Ædiles, seize him!

 Sir, those cold ways,
That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent.   Lay hands upon him,
And bear him to the rock.

 Lay hands upon him.

 He consul!

 Merely awry: when he did love his country,
It honour'd him.

 We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence;
Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
Spread further.

 If it were so,—

 Go not home.

 In this point charge him home, that he affects
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
Enforce him with his envy to the people,
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
Was ne'er distributed.
  Enter an Ædile.
What, will he come?

 How accompanied?

   And when such time they have begun to cry,
Let them not cease, but with a din confused
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence.

   Go about it.
  Exit Ædile.
Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
With us to break his neck.

 But since he hath
Served well for Rome,—

 I talk of that, that know it.

 There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people and his country:
It shall be so.

  Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humbler after it is done
Than when it was a-doing.

  Dismiss them home.
  Exit Ædile. 
Here comes his mother.

 Why?

 They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS.
 I would he had.

 Pray, let us go.

 Well, well, we'll leave you.

 We stood to 't in good time. EnterMenenius. Is this Menenius?

 God-den to you all, god-den to you all.

 Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did.

 Calus Marcus was
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving,—

 The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Sits safe and still without him.
  Enter an Ædile.
 Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us.

 Not possible.
Enter a Messenger.
 Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again.

 But is this true, sir?

 I do not like this news.

 Let's to the Capitol.   Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!

 Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome, towards Marcius.

 You know the very road into his kindness,
And cannot lose your way.

"
308,cor-19,Young Marcius,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-19," A' shall not tread on me;

"
309,cor-12,A Roman Herald,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-12," Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
In honour follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

 Give way there, and go on!

"
311,cor-16,Lieutenant to Aufidius.,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-16," Fear not our care, sir.

 I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
Even by your own.

 Yet I wish, sir—
I mean for your particular,—you had not
Join'd in commission with him; but either
Had borne the action of yourself, or else
To him had left it solely.

 Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

"
312,cor-9,Conspirators with Aufidius.,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-9," How is it with our general?

 Most noble sir,
If you do hold the same intent wherein
You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
Of your great danger.

 The people will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.

 Sir, his stoutness
When he did stand for consul, which he lost
By lack of stooping,—

 So he did, my lord:
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
For no less spoil than glory,—

 Your native town you enter'd like a post,
And had no welcomes home; but he returns,
Splitting the air with noise.

 And patient fools,
Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
With giving him glory.

  Therefore, at your vantage,
Ere he express himself, or move the people
With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
Which we will second. When he lies along,
After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
His reasons with his body.

 Let him die for't. Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

The Conspirators draw, and kill Coriolanus: Aufidius stands on his body.
"
314,cor-40,Two Volscian Guards.,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-40," Stay: whence are you?

 Stand, and go back.

 From whence?

 You may not pass, you must return: our general
Will no more hear from thence.

 You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
You'll speak with Coriolanus.

 Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
Is not here passable.

       Now, sir, is your name Menenius ?

     "
315,cor-39,Volumnia,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-39,"   Indeed, you shall not.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or lose his hire.

 Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
We are fit to bid her welcome.
Exit Gent.
 He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
And tread upon his neck.

Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman.
   One on's father's moods.

 She shall, she shall.

         Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes;
the senate has letters from the general, wherein
he gives my son the whole name of the war:
he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.

    Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie:
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
A sennet. Trumpets sound.
 Enter COMINIUS the general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between  them, CORIOLANUS, crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald.
 Nay, my good soldier, up;
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving honour newly named,—
What is it?—Coriolanus must I call thee?—
But, O, thy wife!

 I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy: only
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.

 O, sir, sir, sir,
I would have had you put your power well on,
Before you had worn it out.

 You might have been enough the man you are,
With striving less to be so: lesser had been
The thwartings of your dispositions, if
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

 Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.

 You are too absolute;
Though therein you can never be too noble,
But when extremities speak.   I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
In peace what each of them by the other lose,
That they combine not there.

 If it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour, as in war, since that to both
It stands in like request?

 Because that now it lies you on to speak
To the people; not by your own instruction,
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
But with such words that are but roted in
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much blood.
I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honour: I am in this,
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you will rather show our general louts
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what that want might ruin.

 I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
And thus far having stretch'd it—here be with them—
Thy knee bussing the stones—for in such business
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
More learned than the ears—waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
As thou hast power and person.

 Prithee now,
Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
Enter COMINIUS.
 He must, and will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

 I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
To have my praise for this, perform a part
Thou hast not done before.

 At thy choice, then:
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy pride thyself.

 Do your will.
Exit.
 Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
And occupations perish!

 My first son,
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee awhile: determine on some course,
More than a wild exposture to each chance
That starts i' the way before thee.

 O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your love!

 If that I could for weeping, you should hear,—
Nay, and you shall hear some. To Brutus
Will you be gone?

 Ay, fool; is that a shame?   Note but this fool.
Was not a man my father?   Hadst thou foxship
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words?

 More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
His good sword in his hand.

 Bastards and all.
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

 'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not have earth to know.

 Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:—
As far as doth the Capitol exceed
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son—
This lady's husband here, this, do you see?—
Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.

 Take my prayers with you.

Exeunt Tribunes.
I would the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
Of what lies heavy to't.

 Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself.
And so shall starve with feeding.   Come, let's go:
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

 O, stand up blest!
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
I kneel before thee; and unproperly
Show duty, as mistaken all this while
Between the child and parent.

Kneels.
 Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

 This is a poor epitome of yours,
Which by the interpretation of full time
May show like all yourself.

 Your knee, sirrah.

 Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
Are suitors to you.

 O, no more, no more!
You have said you will not grant us any thing;
For we have nothing else to ask, but that
Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
That, if you fail in our request, the blame
May hang upon your hardness: therefore, hear us.

 Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
And state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile.   Think with thyself
How more unfortunate than all living women
Are we come hither: since that thy sight, which should
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
Constrains them   weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
Making the mother, wife and child to see
The son, the husband and the father tearing
His country's bowels out. And to poor we
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
Alas, how can we for our country pray,
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
Our comfort in the country. We must find
An evident calamity, though we had
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
With manacles through our streets, or else
Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and children's blood.   For myself, son,
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
March to assault thy country than to tread—
Trust to 't, thou shalt not—on thy mother's womb,
That brought thee to this world.

 Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
Is, that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
'This we received;' and each in either side
Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be blest
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
Whose chronicle thus writ:   'The man was noble,
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
To imitate the graces of the gods;
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak ?
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
Still to remember wrongs?   Daughter, speak you:
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
More bound to's mother; yet here he lets me prate
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
Down, ladies; let us shame him   with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
And die among our neighbours.   Nay, behold 's:
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have,
But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go:
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
I am hush'd until our city be afire,
And then I'll speak a little.

He holds her by the hand, silent.
"

 His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!

 Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

   A crack, madam.

 No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

            O heavens! O heavens!

 You shall stay too: I would I had the power
To say so to my husband.

 What then!
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.

 My lord and husband!

 The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think so.

 We have.

 And grieve to hear 't.
What faults he made before the last, I think
Might have found easy fines: but there to end
Where he was to begin and give away
The benefit of our levies, answering us
With our own charge, making a treaty where
There was a yielding,—this admits no excuse.

 Peace, both, and hear me speak.

 Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Shall have judicious hearing.   Stand, Aufidius,
And trouble not the peace.

 Hold, hold, hold, hold!

 O Tullus,—

 Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.

 Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
Put up your swords.

  Bear from hence his body;
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
As the most noble corse that ever herald
Did follow to his urn.

 His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let's make the best of it.

 I have; 'tis ready.

 I have.

 I shall inform them.

 Very well.

 List to your tribunes.   Audience! peace, I say!

 The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

 Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.

"
323,cor-21,Messenger,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-21," Where's Caius Marcius?

 The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

 They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.

 Within this mile and half.

 The citizens of Corioli have issued,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I came away.

 Above an hour, my lord.

 Spies of the Volsces
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Half an hour since brought my report.

 You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That Marcius shall be consul:
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
The blind to hear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
I never saw the like.

 The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house: some news is come
That turns their countenances.

 Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd.

 It is spoke freely out of many mouths—
How probable I do not know—that Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The young'st and oldest thing.

 You are sent for to the senate:
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Upon our territories; and have already
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
What lay before them.
Enter COMINIUS.
 Sir, if you 'ld save your life, fly to your house:
The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
They'll give him death by inches.
Enter a second Messenger.
 Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

 As certain as I know the sun is fire:
Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together.
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Tabors and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
Make the sun dance. Hark you!

A shout within.
 Sir, we have all
Great cause to give great thanks.

 Almost at point to enter.

The Volsces are in arms.

 Then, worthy Marcius,
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

 Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
Our greatest friends attend us.

 Hence to your homes; be gone!

 Speak, good Cominius:
Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
Rather our state's defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out. To the Tribunes
Masters o' the people,
We do request your kindest ears, and after,
Your loving motion toward the common body,
To yield what passes here.

 Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
What you have nobly done.

 He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him.

 Call Coriolanus.

 To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!

Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus.
 Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.

 Not in this heat, sir, now.

 No more words, we beseech you.

 To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.

 Get you gone.

 The gods forbid!
I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
Leave us to cure this cause.

 Noble tribunes,
It is the humane way: the other course
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning.

 Pray you, let's to him.

Exeunt.
 There's no remedy;
Unless, by not so doing, our good city
Cleave in the midst, and perish.

 Amen, amen.

 Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'"

That they of Rome are enter'd in our counsels
And know how we proceed.

 Our army's in the field:
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us.

 Noble Aufidius,
Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
If they set down before 's, for the remove
Bring up your army; but, I think, you'll find
They've not prepared for us.

 Farewell.

 Farewell. No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
That's lesser than a little. Drums afar off.
Hark! our drums
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn'd with rushes;
They'll open of themselves. Alarum afar off.
Hark you, far off!

Amongst your cloven army.

Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
To answer all the city.

Right worthy you priority.

"
337,cor-4,"Aufidius, Tullus",Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-4," Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state,
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
Reads
'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Cominius Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'

 Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching,
It seem'd, appeared to Rome. By the discovery
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.

 O, doubt not that;
I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more. And keep your honours safe!

 We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

 If I fly, Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.

 Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.

They fight and certain Volsces come in the aid of Aufidius. Marcius fights till they be driven in breathless. 
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
In your condemned seconds.
Exeunt.
 The town is ta'en!

 Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
What good condition can a treaty find
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.

 Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor time of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.

 I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you—
'Tis south the city mills—bring me word thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.

 Where is this fellow?

 Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

 What is thy name?

 Say, what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn,
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name ?

 I know thee not: thy name?

 O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say ‘’Tis true,’ I'ld not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke,
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm for't: thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me:
We have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who am prepared against your territories,
Though not for Rome itself.

 Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenge, take
The one half of my commission; and set down—
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
Thy country's strength and weakness,—thine own ways;
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

Exeunt Coriolanus and Aufidius. The two Servingmen come forward.
 Do they still fly to the Roman?

 I cannot help it now,
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to my person, than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.

 I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
When he shall come to his account, he knows not
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly,
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'er we come to our account.

 All places yield to him ere he sits down;
And the nobility of Rome are his:
The senators and patricians love him too:
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to them; but he could not
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
The happy man; whether defect of judgement,
To fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of these—
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
For I dare so far free him—made him fear'd,
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation of the time:
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
To extol what it hath done.
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
Exeunt. 
 You keep a constant temper.

Exeunt Coriolanus and Aufidius.
 Only their ends
You have respected: stopp'd your ears against
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private whisper, no, not with such friends
That thought them sure of you.

 I was moved withal.

 I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour
At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
Myself a former fortune.

The Ladies make signs to Coriolanus.
 Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
Bid them repair to the market-place; where I,
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to appear before the people, hoping
To purge himself with words: dispatch.

Exeunt Attendants.
Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction.
Most welcome!

 Even so
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
And with his charity slain.

 Sir, I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find the people.

 I know it;
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction.   I raised him, and I pawn'd
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
He bow'd his nature, never known before
But to be rough, unswayable and free.

 That I would have spoke of;
Being banish'd for 't, he came unto my hearth;
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
My best and freshest men; served his designments
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
Which he did end all his; and took some pride
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with his countenance, as if
I had been mercenary.

 There was it:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!

Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People.
 Say no more:
Here come the lords.
Enter the Lords of the city.
 I have not deserved it.
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
What I have written to you?

 He approaches: you shall hear him.
Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; Commoners being with him.
 Read it not, noble lords;
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
He hath abused your powers.

 Ay, traitor, Marcius!

 Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
Coriolanus in Corioli?
You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
He has betray'd your business, and given up,
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
Look'd wondering each at other.

 Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

 No more.

 Why, noble lords,
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore your own eyes and ears?

 Insolent villain!

 My noble masters, hear me speak.

 My lords, when you shall know—as in this rage,
Provoked by him, you cannot—the great danger
Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.

 My rage is gone;
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Which to this hour bewail the injury,
Yet he shall have a noble memory.
Assist.

Exeunt, bearing the body of Coriolanus. A dead march sounded.

That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her choppy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.

 Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair?   I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show?   My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate.

 The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them.   Whither are they vanish'd?

 Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?

 You shall be king.

 To the selfsame tune and words.
Who's here?
Enter ROSS and ANGUS.
 What, can the devil speak true?

 That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray 's
In deepest consequence.
Cousins, a word, I pray you.

 Look, how our partner's rapt.

 New honours come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use.

 Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

 Very gladly.

 There if I grow,
The harvest is your own.

 This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
Where they most breed and haunt I have observed,
The air is delicate.
Enter LADY MACBETH.
 How goes the night, boy?

 And she goes down at twelve.

 Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose!
Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch.
Give me my sword.
Who's there?

 What, sir, not yet at rest?  The king's a-bed:
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
In measureless content.

 All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
To you they have show'd some truth.

 At your kind'st leisure.

 So I lose none
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
I shall be counsell'd.

 Thanks, sir: the like to you!
Exeunt Banquo and Fleance.
 Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
And say it is not so.
Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS.
 Look to the lady:
[Lady Macbeth is carried out.
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
And question this most bloody piece of work,
To know it further.   Fears and scruples shake us:
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice.

 Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity,
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings.   If there come truth from them--
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope?   But hush! no more.
Sennet sounded.
Enter MACBETH, as king,
LADY MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.
 Let your highness
Command upon me; to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit.

 Ay, my good lord.

 As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain.

 My lord, I will not.

 Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon's.

 Give us a light there, ho!

 It will be rain to-night.

 O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!

 Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
Some say he's mad: others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
Within the belt of rule.

 Well, march we on,
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
And with him pour we in our country's purge
Each drop of us.

"
386,doct.,Doctor,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml-doct.," Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls

Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
They presently amend.

   You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.

            Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think, but dare not speak.

 Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
That keep her from her rest.

 Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.

 Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
Makes us hear something.

 Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
Profit again should hardly draw me here.

 So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
Exit Sergeant, attended.
Who comes here?
Enter Ross.
 Whence camest thou, worthy thane?

 Great happiness!

 No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.

 What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.
Exeunt. Is execution done on Cawdor?   Are not
Those in commission yet return'd?

 There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face:
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.
Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS.
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay.

 Welcome hither:
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
No less to have done so, let me infold thee
And hold thee to my heart.

 My plenteous joys,
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
And you whose places are the nearest, know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
Not unaccompanied invest him only,
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
And bind us further to you.

 My worthy Cawdor!

 True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
And in his commendations I am fed;
It is a banquet to me.   Let's after him,
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
It is a peerless kinsman.
[Flourish. Exeunt. This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.

 See, see, our honour'd hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
And thank us for your trouble.

 Where's the thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest to-night.

 Give me your hand;
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
And shall continue our graces towards him.

And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--'Give me,' quoth I:
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

 Thou'rt kind.

 I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his pent-house lid;
He shall live a man forbid:
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
Look what I have.

Wreck'd as homeward he did come.

Or from our masters?

Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
From the murderer's gibbet throw,
Into the flame.

The close contriver of all harms,
Was never call'd to bear my part,
Or show the glory of our art?
And, which is worse, all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son,
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now: get you gone,
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i' the morning: thither he
Will come to know his destiny:
Your vessels and your spells provide,
Your charms and every thing beside.

Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
Great business must be wrought ere noon:
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
And that distill'd by magic sleights
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion:
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
His hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
And you all know, security
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.

 He had none:
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.

 Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly?   He loves us not;
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear and nothing is the love;
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.

 Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.

 Sirrah, your father's dead:
And what will you do now?   How will you live?

 What, with worms and flies?

 Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
The pitfall nor the gin.

 Yes, he is dead: how wilt thou do for a father?

 Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

 Thou speak'st with all thy wit; and yet, i' faith,
With wit enough for thee.

        Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defence,
To say I have done no harm?

To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.'   Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.

 Thou'rt mad to say it:
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation.

 Give him tending;
He brings great news. Exit Messenger.
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief!   Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!' Enter MACBETH.
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.

 And when goes hence?

 O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under 't. He that's coming
Must be provided for: and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

 Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.
Exeunt. All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
We rest your hermits.

 Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs in compt,
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
Still to return your own.

 He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?

 Know you not he has?

 Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely?   From this time
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valour
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
Like the poor cat i' the adage?

 What beast was't, then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
And, to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this.

 We fail!
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?

 Who dares receive it other,
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
Upon his death?

 That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath give my fire.
Hark!Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern'st good-night.   He is about it:
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die.

 Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
Confounds us. Hark!   I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done't.
Enter MACBETH.
My husband!

 I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?

 Now.

 Ay.

 Donalbain.

 There are two lodged together.

 Consider it not so deeply.

 These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

 What do you mean?

 Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
You do unbend your noble strength, to think
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood.

 Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
For it must seem their guilt.
[Exit. Knocking within.
 My hands are of your colour; but I shame
To wear a heart so white. [Knocking within.] I hear a knocking
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber:
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it, then!   Your constancy
Hath left you unattended. [Knocking within.]
Hark! more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts.

 What's the business,
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!

 Woe, alas!
What, in our house?

 Help me hence, ho!

 If he had been forgotten,
It had been as a gap in our great feast,
And all-thing unbecoming.

 Is Banquo gone from court?

 Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
For a few words.

 Nought's had, all's spent,
Where our desire is got without content:
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
Enter MACBETH.
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on?   Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what's done is done.

 Come on;
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
Be bright and jovial among your guests to night.

 You must leave this.

 But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

 What's to be done?

 Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
For my heart speaks they are welcome.
First Murderer appears at the door.
 My royal lord,
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it.

 Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well: if much you note him,
You shall offend him and extend his passion:
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?

 O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear:
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
Led you to Duncan.   O, these flaws and starts,
Impostors to true fear, would well become
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces!   When all's done,
You look but on a stool.

 What, quite unmann'd in folly?

 Fie, for shame!

 My worthy lord,
Your noble friends do lack you.

 Think of this, good peers,
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

 You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
With most admired disorder.

 I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
Question enrages him. At once, good night:
Stand not upon the order of your going,
But go at once.

 A kind good night to all!
Exeunt all but Macbeth and Lady M.
 Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

 Did you send to him, sir?

 You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

      "
397,len.,Lennox,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml-len.," What a haste looks through his eyes!
So should he look
That seems to speak things strange.

 Good morrow, noble sir.

 Goes the king hence to-day?

 The night has been unruly: where we lay,
Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
And prophesying with accents terrible
Of dire combustion and confused events
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
Was feverous and did shake.

 My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it.
Re-enter MACDUFF.
               What's the matter?

 Mean you his majesty?

 Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done't:
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood;
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
<l>Upon their pillows:

They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
Was to be trusted with them.

 May 't please your highness sit.
The Ghost of Banquo enters, and sits in Macbeth's place.
 Here is a place reserved, sir.

 Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?

 Good night; and better health
Attend his majesty!

 My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Which can interpret further: only, I say,
Things have been strangely borne.   The gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
Whom, you may say, if 't please you, Fleance kill'd,
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth!   did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done?   Ay, and wisely too;
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
He has borne all things well: and I do think
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they should find
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
Where he bestows himself?

 Sent he to Macduff?

 And that well might
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England and unfold
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursed!

 What's your grace's will?

 No, my lord.

 No, indeed, my lord.

 'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England.

 Ay, my good lord.

 For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
And many unrough youths that even now
Protest their first of manhood.

 Or so much as it needs,
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
Make we our march towards Birnam.
Exeunt, marching."
398,lord.,Lord,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml-lord.," The son of Duncan,
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,
Lives in the English court, and is received
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
That by the help of these--with Him above
To ratify the work--we may again
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
All which we pine for now: and this report
Hath so exasperated the king that he
Prepares for some attempt of war.

 He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
That clogs me with this answer.'

 I'll send my prayers with him.
Exeunt."
399,lords.,Lords,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml-lords.," Thanks to your majesty.

 What, my good lord?

 Our duties, and the pledge.
Re-enter Ghost.
"
400,macb.,Macbeth,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml-macb.," So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

 Speak, if you can: what are you?

 Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
Witches vanish. 
 Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind.   Would they had stay'd!

 Your children shall be kings.
 And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?

 The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes?

 Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus]
Thanks for your pains.
[To Ban.]
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them?

 Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
[Aside]
This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in truth?   I am thane of Cawdor:
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature?   Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings:
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man that function
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
But what is not.

 If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
Without my stir.

 Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

 Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.

 Till then, enough. Come, friends.
[Exeunt. The service and the loyalty I owe,
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
Is to receive our duties; and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants,
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
Safe toward your love and honour.

 The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach;
So humbly take my leave.

 The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
Let not light see my black and deep desires:
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
[Exit.
 My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.

 To-morrow, as he purposes.

 We will speak further.

 If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly: if the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
With his surcease success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
We still have judgement here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself.   Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
And falls on the other.
Enter LADY MACBETH.
How now! what news?

 Hath he ask'd for me?

 We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
Not cast aside so soon.

 Prithee, peace:
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none.

 If we should fail?

 Bring forth men-children only;
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
That they have done't?

 I am settled, and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
Exeunt. A friend.

 Being unprepared,
Our will became the servant to defect;
Which else should free have wrought.

 I think not of them:
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that business,
If you would grant the time.

 If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
It shall make honour for you.

 Good repose the while!

 Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
Exit Servant.
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand?   Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
The curtain'd sleep; withcraft celebrates
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
And take the present horror from the time,
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
A bell rings.
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
Exit. Who's there? what, ho!

 I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?

 When?

 As I descended?

 Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?

 This is a sorry sight.
Looking on his hands.
Lady M. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

 There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried 'Murder!'
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
Again to sleep.

 One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
When they did say 'God bless us!'

 But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
Stuck in my throat.

 Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep,' the innocent sleep,
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleave of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast--

 Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.

 I'll go no more:
I am afraid to think what I have done;
Look on't again I dare not.

 Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand?   No, this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
Making the green one red.
Re-enter LADY MACBETH.
 To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
[Knocking within.]
Wake Duncan with thy knocking!  I would thou couldst!
[Exeunt. Good morrow, both.

 Not yet.

 I'll bring you to him.

 The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.

 He does: he did appoint so.

 'Twas a rough night.

               What's the matter?

 What is't you say? the life?

 Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
There's nothing serious in mortality:
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of.

 You are, and do not know't:
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.

 O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
That I did kill them.

 Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
Loyal and neutral, in a moment?   No man:
The expedition of my violent love
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who coul refrain,
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make's love known?

 Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
And meet i' the hall together.

 Here's our chief guest.

 To-night we hold a solemn supper, sir,
And I'll request your presence.

 Ride you this afternoon?

 We should have else desired your good advice,
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
Is't far you ride?

 Fail not our feast.

 We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
In England and in Ireland, not confessing
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
With strange invention:   but of that to-morrow,
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
Till your return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

 I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
And so I do commend you to their backs.
Farewell.
[Exit Banquo. 
Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night: to make society
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!
Exeunt all but Macbeth, and an attendant.
Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
Our pleasure?

 Bring them before us.
Exit Attendant.
To be thus is nothing;
But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
To act in safety.   There is none but he
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me,
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man,
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
Rather than so, come fate into the list,
And champion me to the utterance!   Who's there?
Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers.
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
Exit Attendant.
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

 Well then, now
Have you consider'd of my speeches?   Know
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune, which you thought had been
Our innocent self: this I made good to you
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments,
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'

 I did so, and went further, which is now
Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
To pray for this good man and for his issue,
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
And beggar'd yours for ever?

 Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept
All by the name of dogs: the valued file
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive
Particular addition, from the bill
That writes them all alike: and so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file,
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say't;
And I will put that business in your bosoms,
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
Which in his death were perfect.

 Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.

 So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my near'st of life: and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is;
That I to your assistance do make love,
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons.

 Your spirits shine through you.
Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
The moment on't; for't must be done to night,
And something from the palace; always thought
That I require a clearness: and with him--
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
I'll come to you anon.

 I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
Exeunt Murderers.   
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.
Exit. We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.

 So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
Unsafe the while, that we
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
Disguising what they are.

 O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.

 There's comfort yet; they are as- sailable;
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note.

 Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed.   Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale!   Light thickens; and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood:
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still:
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me.
Exeunt. You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
And last the hearty welcome.

 Ourself will mingle with society,
And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
We will require her welcome.

 See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a meas ure
The table round.   Approaching the door.
There's blood upon thy face.

 'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatch'd?

 Thou art the best o' the cut-throats:  yet he's good
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
Thou art the nonpareil.

 Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
As broad and general as the casing air:
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
To saucy doubts and fears.  But Banquo's safe?

 Thanks for that:
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to morrow
We'll hear, ourselves, again.
Exit Murderer.
 Sweet remembrancer!
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both!

 Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance!

 The table's full.

 Where?

 Which of you have done this?

 Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
Thy gory locks at me.

 Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil.

 Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo! how say you?
Why, what care I?   If thou canst nod, speak too.
If charnel-houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back, our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites.
Ghost vanishes.
 If I stand here, I saw him.

 Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal;
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
Too terrible for the ear: the time has been,
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end; but now they rise again,
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
And push us from our stools: this is more strange
Than such a murder is.

 I do forget.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends;
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
And all to all.

 Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with!

 What man dare, I dare:
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!
Ghost vanishes.
Why, so: being gone,
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.

 Can such things be,
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
Without our special wonder?   You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe,
When now I think you can behold such sights,
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
When mine is blanch'd with fear.

 It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
Augurs and understood relations have
By magot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?

 How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding?

 I hear it by the way; but I will send:
There's not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
By the worst means, the worst.   For mine own good,
All causes shall give way: I am in blood
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.

 Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
We are yet but young in deed.
Exeunt. How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What is't you do?

 I conjure you, by that which you profess,
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature's germens tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken; answer me
To what I ask you.

 Call 'em; let me see 'em.

 Tell me, thou unknown power,--

 Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one word more,--

 Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.

 Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
And sleep in spite of thunder.
Thunder.
Third Apparition:  a Child
crowned, with a tree in his hand.
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king,
And wears upon his baby-brow the round
And top of sovereignty?

 That will never be:
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
Unfix his earth-bound root?   Sweet bodements good!
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
To time and mortal custom.   Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?

 I will be satisfied: deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you!   Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
Hautboys. 
 Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo; down!
Thy crown doth sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
Which shows me many more; and some I see
That two-fold balls and treble sceptres carry:
Horrible sight!   Now, I see, 'tis true;
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
And points at them for his.
[Apparitions vanish.] What, is this so?

 Where are they? Gone! Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
Come in, without there!
Enter LENNOX.
 Saw you the weird sisters?

 Came they not by you?

 Infected be the air whereon they ride;
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?

 Fled to England!

 Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
Unless the deed go with it: from this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool:
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
Come, bring me where they are.
Exeunt. Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
I cannot taint with fear.   What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?   The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly, false thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures:
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
Enter a Servant.
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose look?

 Geese, villain!

 Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

 Take thy face hence.
Exit Servant.
Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough: my way of life
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
And that which should accompany old age,
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
Seyton!
Enter SEYTON.
 What news more?

 I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Give me my armour.

 I'll put it on.
Send out moe horses; skirr the country round;
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
How does your patient, doctor?

 Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?

 Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
Seyton, send out.   Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo,
That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,
Would scour these English hence?   Hear'st thou of them?

 Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane,
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

 Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up:
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.
A cry of women within.
What is that noise?

 I have almost forgot the taste of fears:
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
Cannot once start me.
Re-enter SEYTON.
Wherefore was that cry?

 She should have died hereafter;
There would have been a time for such a word.
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
Enter a Messenger.
Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

 Well, say, sir.

 Liar and slave!

 If thou speak'st false,
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
I care not if thou dost for me as much.
I pull in resolution, and begin
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
If this which he avouches does appear,
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun,
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
At least we'll die with harness on our back.
Exeunt. They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
That was not born of woman?   Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.
Enter young SIWARD.
 Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

 My name's Macbeth.

 No, nor more fearful.

 Thou wast born of woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
[Exit.
Alarums. Enter MACDUFF.
 Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
Do better upon them.
Enter MACDUFF.
 Of all men else I have avoided thee:
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.

 Thou losest labour:
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
To one of woman born.

 Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
That palter with us in a double sense;
That keep the word of promise to our ear,
And break it to our hope.   I'll not fight with thee.

 I will not yield,
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last. Before my body
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
And damn'd be him that first cries 'Hold, enough!'
Exeunt, fighting. Alarums.
Retreat. Flourish.
Enter, with drum and
colours, MALCOLM, old SIWARD, ROSS, the
other Thanes, and Soldiers.
"
401,macd.,Macduff,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml-macd.," Was it so late, friend, ere you  went to bed,
That you do lie so late?

   Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.

 Is the king stirring, worthy thane?

 He did command me to call timely on him:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.

 I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
But yet 'tis one.

 I'll make so bold to call,
For 'tis my limited service.
Exit.
 O horror, horror, horror!   Tongue nor heart
Cannot conceive nor name thee!

 Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
The life o' the building!

 Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
See, and then speak yourselves.
Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox.
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarum-bell.   Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
And look on death itself! up, up, and see
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
Bell rings.
Enter LADY MACBETH.
 O gentle lady,
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
The repetition, in a woman's ear,
Would murder as it fell.
Enter BANQUO.
O Banquo, Banquo,
Our royal master's murder'd!

 Your royal father's murdered.

 Wherefore did you so?

 Look to the lady.

 And so do I.

 Why, see you not?

 Those that Macbeth hath slain.

 They were suborn'd:
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed.

 He is already named, and gone to Scone
To be invested.

 Carried to Colmekill,
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
And guardian of their bones.

 No, cousin, I'll to Fife.

 Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

 Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
Bestride our downfall'n birthdom: each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
Like syllable of dolour.

 I am not treacherous.

 I have lost my hopes.

 Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not check thee: wear thou thy wrongs;
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
And the rich East to boot.

 What should he be?

 Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more dam'd
In evils to top Macbeth.

 Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours: you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
That vulture in you, to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
Finding it so inclined.

 This avarice
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,
Of your mere own: all these are portable,
With other graces weigh'd.

 O Scotland, Scotland!

 Fit to govern!
No, not to live. O nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accursed,
And does blaspheme his breed?   Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!

 Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
'Tis hard to reconcile.
Enter a Doctor.
 What's the disease he means?

 See, who comes here?

 My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

 Stands Scotland where it did?

 O, relation
Too nice, and yet too true!

 How does my wife?

 And all my children?

 The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?

 Be not a niggard of your speech:  how goes't?

 What concern they?
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast?

 If it be mine,
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

 Hum! I guess at it.

 My children too?

 And I must be from thence!
My wife kill'd too?

 He has no children. All my pretty ones?
Did you say all?   O hell-kite!   All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop?

 I shall do so;
But I must also feel it as a man:
I cannot but remember such things were,
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!

 O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue!   But, gentle heavens,
Cut short all intermission; front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
Within my sword's length set him; if he scape,
Heaven forgive him too!

 Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.

 Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
[Exeunt.
 That way the noise is.  Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
I sheathe again undeeded.   There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter, one of the greatest note
Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
And more I beg not.
Exit. Alarums.
Enter MALCOLM and old SIWARD. 
 Turn, hell-hound, turn!

 I have no words:
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out!
They fight.
 Despair thy charm;
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
Untimely ripp'd.

 Then yield thee, coward,
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,
'Here may you see the tyrant.'

 Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
That speak my salutation in their minds;
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
Hail, King of Scotland!

"
402,mal.,Malcolm,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml-mal.," This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.

 The worthy thane of Ross.

 My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die: who did report
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
Implor'd your highness' pardon and set forth
A deep repentance: nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it; he died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
As 'twere a careless trifle.

 O, by whom?

 Why do we hold our tongues,
That most may claim this argument for ours?

 Nor our strong sorrow
Upon the foot of motion.

 What will you do?   Let's not consort with them:
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy.   I'll to England.

 This murderous shaft that's shot
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.
Exeunt. Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.

 What I believe I'll wail,
What know believe, and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well;
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young; but something
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
To appease an angry god.

 But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge.   But I shall crave your pardon;
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell:
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Yet grace must still look so.

 Perchance even there where I di find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Without leave-taking?   I pray you,
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
Whatever I shall think.

 Be not offended:
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds: I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.

 It is myself I mean: in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
With my confineless harms.

 I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness:   your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
All continent impediments would o'erbear
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.

 With this there grows
In my most ill-composed affection such
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
Desire his jewels and this other's house:
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth.

 But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.

 If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
I am as I have spoken.

 Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour.  Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
>From over-credulous haste: but God above

Deal between thee and me! for even now
I put myself to thy direction, and
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
At no time broke my faith, would not betray
The devil to his fellow and delight
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
Is thine and my poor country's to command:
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel!  Why are you silent?

 Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?

 I thank you, doctor.
Exit Doctor.
 'Tis call'd the evil:
A most miraculous work in this good king;
Which often, since my here-remain in England,
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction.   With this strange virtue,
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
That speak him full of grace.
Enter Ross.
 My countryman; but yet I know him not.

 I know him now. Good God, btimes remove
The means that makes us strangers!

 What's the newest grief?

 Be't their comfort
We are coming thither: gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out.

 Merciful heaven!
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
Give sorrow words: the grief that does no speak
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.

 Be comforted:
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
To cure this deadly grief.

 Dispute it like a man.

 Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

 This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
Our lack is nothing but our leave: Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
The night is long that never finds the day.
Exeunt. Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.

 Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.

 'Tis his main hope:
For where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too.

 Now near enough: your leavy screens throw down,
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon's what else remains to do,
According to our order.

 We have met with foes
That strike beside us.

 I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

 Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

 He's worth more sorrow,
And that I'll spend for him.

 We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves,
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honour named.   What's more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
Took off her life; this, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
We will perform in measure, time and place:
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
Flourish. Exeunt."
403,ment.,Menteith,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml-ment.," The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.

 What does the tyrant?

 Who then shall blame
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there?

 We doubt it nothing.

 So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.

 Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
If you will take a homely man's advice,
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you
I dare abide no longer.
Exit.
 Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do it.

 As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
The wood began to move.

 Let me endure your wrath, if 't be not so:
Within this three mile may you see it coming;
I say, a moving grove.

 From Fife, great king;
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
With terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm,
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us.

 That now
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition;
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

 I'll see it done.

 The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success; and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
Came post with post; and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
And pour'd them down before him.

 And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
For it is thine.

 Ah, good father,
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
When living light should kiss it?

 And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
War with mankind.

 They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
That look'd upon 't.   Here comes the good Macduff.
Enter MACDUFF.
How goes the world, sir, now?

 Is 't known who did this more than bloody deed?

 Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?

 'Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
Thine own life's means!   Then 'tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

 Where is Duncan's body?

 Will you to Scone?

 Well, I will thither.

 Farewell, father.

 His absence, sir,
Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
To grace us with your royal company.

 Gentlemen, rise; his highness is not well.

 What sights, my lord?

 You must have patience, madam.

 You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

 My dearest coz,
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further;
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
>From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,

But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you!

 I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
I take my leave at once.
Exit.
 Sir, amen.

 Alas, poor country!
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; wher nothing,
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile:
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy: the dead man's knell
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or ere they sicken.

 That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
Each minute teems a new one.

 Why, well.

 Well too.

 No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

 When I came hither to transport the tidings,
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
To doff their dire distresses.

 Would I could answer
This comfort with the like! But I have words
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
Where hearing should not latch them.

 No mind that's honest
But in it shares some woe; though the main part
Pertains to you alone.

 Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.

 Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
To add the death of you.

 Wife, children, servants, all
That could be found.

 I have said.

 Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
He only lived but till he was a man;
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
But like a man he died.

 Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth, for then
It hath no end.

 Ay, on the front.

As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villanies of nature
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.

 As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
Discomfort swells.   Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
Began a fresh assault.

 Yes;
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:

Or memorize another Golgotha,

That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince,
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You, Capulet, shall go along with me:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

Exeunt all but Montague, Lady Montague, and Benvolio.
 Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

 Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

 Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

 And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body, and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

Exeunt.
 What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others.
 What fear is this which startles in our ears?

 Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.
Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?

 Look, and thou shalt see.
Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave?

 Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

 Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

 We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

 Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

 This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies?   Capulet!   Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

 A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show   his head:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

 Younger than she are happy mothers made.

 These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

 Monday, my lord.

 My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

 My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

 Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

 Happily met, my lady and my wife!

 That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

 Come you to make confession to this father?

 Do not deny to him that you love me.

 So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

 Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

 Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

 Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

 God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

Exit.
 Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

 Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, by thee beguiled,
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!

 Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging   up   of graves,
But thou shalt hear it; whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

 Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The Page whistles.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What, with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
Retires.
Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, &c.
 This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.

Comes forward.
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

 I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

 O, I am slain! Falls.
If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

429,mon.,MONTAGUE,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-mon.," Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

 Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

  Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

  I neither know it nor can learn of him.

 Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
Enter ROMEO.
  I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true shrift.   Come, madam, let's away.
Exeunt Montague and Lady. 
 Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.

 But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

 My sword, I say!   Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE.
 But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.

 But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

 And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice,
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
Come, go with me.
To Serv., giving a paper. Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona: find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

Exeunt Capulet and Paris.
 Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistress! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen!   Come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

Music plays, and they dance.
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

 What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

 Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.

 Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

 Young Romeo is it?

 Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

 He shall be endured:
What, goodman, boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him!   God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop!   you'll be the man!

 Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts!   You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or--More light, more light!   For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

 Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all;
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here!   Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'll to my rest.

Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse.
 Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

 Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
But, soft! what day is this?

 Monday! ha, ha!   Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

 Well, get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so very late,
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night.
Exeunt.
 When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright.
How now a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore showering?   In one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

 Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

 How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
And yet 'not proud:' mistress minion, you,
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

 Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!

 And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

 O, God ye god-den.

 Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
For here we need it not.

 God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match'd: and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
I am too young! I pray you, pardon me.'
But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on 't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
Exit. 
 So many guests invite as here are writ. Exit First Servant. 
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

  Go, be gone. Exit Sec. Servant.
We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

 Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

 How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

 Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

 Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
This is as't should be.   Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
All our whole city is much bound to him.

 Good nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
 Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
 Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
Spare not for cost.

 No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

 Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near.

Music within.
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Re-enter Nurse.
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste, I say.
Exeunt.
 For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

 Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold;
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

 Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians.
 Ready to go, but never to return.
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife.   There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

 Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou!   Alack! my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried.

 All things that we ordained festival,
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.

 What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

 O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en,--for, lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

 O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

 As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

"

 'Tis more, 'tis more: his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.

"
432,rom.,ROMEO,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-rom.," Is the day so young?

 Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

 Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

 Out--

 Out of her favour, where I am in love.

 Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine?   O me!   What fray was here?
Yet, tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

 Good heart, at what?

 Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.

 Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

 What, shall I groan and tell thee?

 Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

 A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

 Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.

 She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

 O, teach me how I should forget to think.

 'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

 Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

 For your broken shin.

 Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

       When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

 I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendour of mine own.

Exeunt.
 What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?

 Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

 Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

 I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound.
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

 Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

 A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

 Nay, that's not so.

 And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.

 I dream'd a dream to-night.

 Well, what was yours?

 In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

 Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.

 I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels and expires the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail!   On, lusty gentlemen.

 What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?

 O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

 If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

 Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

 O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

 Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

 Sin from my lips?   O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

 What is her mother?

 Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

 Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

 Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it.
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO. 
 He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

Juliet appears above at a window.
But, soft!  what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks, yet she says nothing:   what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!

 She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

 Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

 I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

 By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

 Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

 With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

 Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.

 I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And thou but love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

 By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.

 Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

 What shall I swear by?

 If my heart's dear love--

 O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

 The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

 Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

 O blessed, blessed   night! I am afeard,
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
Re-enter JULIET, above.
 So thrive my soul--

 A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Retiring. 
Re-enter JULIET, above.
 It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!

 My dear?

 At the hour of nine.

 Let me stand here till thou remember it.

 And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.

 I would I were thy bird.

 Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell.
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

Exit.
 Good morrow, father.

 That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

 With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

 I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.

 Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.

 Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

 And bad'st me bury love.

 I pray thee, chide not: she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.

 O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

    A most courteous exposition.

                 Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

  And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

 What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

 I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

   Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine.

 Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.

 Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

 I do protest, I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

 Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

 Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
Tybalt under Romeo's arm stabs Mercutio,
and flies with his followers. 
 Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

  This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
Re-enter BENVOLIO.
 This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe others must end.

 Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
Re-enter TYBALT.
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

 This shall determine that.

They fight; Tybalt falls.
 O, I am fortune's fool!

 Father, what news! what is the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?

 What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

 Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

 There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death: then banished,
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it; how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

 O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

 Yet 'banished'?   Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

 How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

 Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou
tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

Knocking within.
 Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

Knocking.
 Nurse!

 Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

 As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as the name's cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.
Drawing his sword,
 Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

 How well my comfort is revived by this!

 But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were grief, so brief to part with thee:
Farewell.
Exeunt.
 It was the lark, the herald of the morn
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

 Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul? let 's talk; it is not day.

 More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
Enter Nurse, to the chamber.
 Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
He goeth down. 
 Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

 I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.

 And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

Exit.
 If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!--
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
That I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
Where but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
Enter BALTHASAR, booted.
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

 Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

 Tush, thou art deceived:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

 No matter: get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
Exit Balthasar. 
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary,--
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
'An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!
Enter Apothecary.
 Come hither, man.   I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

 Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

 I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

 There's thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

Exeunt.
 Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter: early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seeest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

 So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

 Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
Opens the tomb. 
 I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee.   I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head,
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

 Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
They fight. 
 In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode?   I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so?   O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave?   O, no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.

Laying Paris in the tomb.
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning?   O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin!   Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
And never from this palace of dim night

Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh.   Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love! Drinks.
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
Dies.
Enter, at the other end of the churchyard,
FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade.
"
433,mer.,MERCUTIO,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-mer.," Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

 You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.

 And, to sink it in, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

 If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in:
A visor for a visor! what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

 Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

 I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgement sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

 Why, may one ask?

 And so did I.

 That dreamers often lie.

 O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she--

 True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

 He is wise;
And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.

 Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

 This cannot anger him:  'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
I conjure only but to raise up him.

 If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
O, Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night!   I'll to my tuckle-bed!
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?

 Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?

 Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

                           An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar, Is very good meat in lent:
But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score, When it hoars ere it be spent.
          Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Enter ROMEO.
 But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him man.

 O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Draws.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

  Come, sir, your passado.
They fight.
 I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

 Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page?   Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
Exit Page. 
  Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your houses!
Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio.
"
434,ben.,BENVOLIO,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-ben.,"  I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.

 Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.

 Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

 My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

 Have you importuned him by any means?
 See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
 Good morrow, cousin.

 But new struck nine.

 It was.   What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

 In love?

 Of love?

 Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

 No, coz, I rather weep.

 At thy good heart's oppression.

 Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

 Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

 Groan! why, no:
But sadly tell me who.

 I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

 A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

 Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

 Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

 By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

 I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
Exeunt. 
 Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.

 For what, I pray thee?

 Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

 At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

 Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

 The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

 Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs.

 This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

 Strike, drum.

Exeunt.
 Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.

 Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

 He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.

 An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

 Come, he hath hid himself among these trees.
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

 Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

Exeunt.
  Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

          I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not escape a brawl:
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

     We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

 What, art thou hurt?

 O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

 Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

 Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

 Why dost thou stay?

Exit Romeo.
Enter Citizens, &c.
 There lies that Tybalt.

 O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

 Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them   rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain,
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

"
435,tyb.,TYBALT,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-tyb.," What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

 What, drawn, and talk of peace!   I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have to thee, coward!
They fight.
Enter several of both houses, who join the
fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs. 
 This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy.   What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

 Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.

 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

 It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him.

 Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

 Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

Exit.
 Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

   Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

 Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,--thou art a villain.

 Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

 What wouldst thou have with me?

 I am for you.
Drawing.
 Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.

"
436,fri.-l.,FRIAR LAURENCE,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-fri.-l.," The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Enter ROMEO.
 Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or, if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

 God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

 That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?

 Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

 Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
And thou art changed? pronounce this sentence then,
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

 For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

 Not in a grave,
To lay one in, another out to have.

 O, she knew well
Thy love did not read by rote and could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

 Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Exeunt. 
 So smile the heavens, upon this holy act,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

 These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Enter JULIET.
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

 Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

 Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.

Exeunt.
 Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
And thou art wedded to calamity.
Enter ROMEO.
 Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company:
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

 A gentler judgement vanish'd from his lips,
Not body's death, but body's banishment.

 Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

 O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
Taking my part, hath rush'd aside the law,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

 Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.

 I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

 O, then I see that mad men have no ears.

 Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

 Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.

 Hark, how they knock!   Who's there? Romeo, arise;
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;

Knocking.
Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
What simpleness is this!   I come, I come!

Knocking.
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

 Welcome, then.
Enter Nurse.
 There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

 Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amazed me; by my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thy, self?
And slay thy lady too that lives in thee,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Which like a usurer, abound'st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Mis-shapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
Is set a-fire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there art thou happy too;
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
But look thou stay not the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.

 Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here:
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

 On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

 You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the course, I like it not.

 I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
Enter JULIET.
 That's a certain text.

 My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

 Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this county.

 Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That copest with death himself to scape from it;
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

 Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
No warmth, no breath, shall testify   thou livest;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
Each part, deprived of supple government,
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
Then, as the manner of our country is,
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from   this present shame;
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

 Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

 Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

 Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid:
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
She's not well married that lives married long;
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
In all her best array bear her to church:
For though fond nature bids us all lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

 Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
Move them   no more by crossing their high will.
Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, 
Paris, and Friar.

 This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

 Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

 Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
Unto my cell.

 Now must I to the monument alone;
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
Exit. 
 Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

 Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
It burneth in the Capels' monument.

 Who is it?

 How long hath he been there?

 Go with me to the vault.

 Stay, then; I'll go alone.   Fear comes upon me:
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

 Romeo!
Advances.
Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
Enters the tomb.
Romeo! O, pale!   Who else? what, Paris too?
And steep'd in blood?   Ah, what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chancel
The lady stirs.
Juliet wakes.
 I hear some noise.   Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away,
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
Come, go, good Juliet, Noise again
I dare no longer stay.

 I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me, of this direful murder:
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excused.

 I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form   of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patience;
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,

Enter FRIAR LAURENCE.
 Going to find a bare-foot brother out,
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

 I could not send it,--here it is again,--
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.

 Brother, I'll go and bring it thee,

Exit.

Her body sleeps in Capels' monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
And presently took post to tell it you:
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

 I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.

 No, my good lord.

 I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

 For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.

Retires.
 Here's one a friend, and one that knows you well.

 It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
One that you love.

 Romeo.

 Full half an hour.

 I dare not, sir:
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And fearfully did menace me with death,
If I did stay to look on his intents.

 As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.

 I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threaten'd me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not and left him there.

 Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

 This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

   Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

 Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?

 Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid.   Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

 Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

 What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament
And see how one another lends content,
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.

 Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

 We follow thee. Exit Servant.
Juliet, the county stays.

 Tybalt, my cousin!  O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
Of my dear kinsman!  Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!

 He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them   fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

 I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

 Ho, daughter! are you up?

 Why, how now, Juliet!

 Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

 So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.

 Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.

 That same villain, Romeo.

 That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

 We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Then weep no more.   I'll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

 Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

 Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

 Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

 Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.
Enter CAPULET and Nurse.
 Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave!

 Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

 You are too hot.

 Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

Exit.
 No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

 We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.

 What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

 Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.
 Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

 Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.

Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.
 What noise is here?

 What is the matter?

 O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help! Call help.
Enter CAPULET.
 Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

 O woful time!

 Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch'd it from   my sight!

 The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry, toward our monument.

 O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
Enter MONTAGUE and others.
"
450,jul.,JULIET,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-jul.," How now! who calls?

 Madam, I am here,
What is your will?

 And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

 It is an honour that I dream not of.

 I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
Enter a Servant.
 Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

 Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

 Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

 Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

 You kiss by the book.

 Come hither, nurse.   What is yond gentleman?

 What's he that now is going out of door?

 What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

 Go, ask his name: if he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

 My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.

 A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.
One calls within
'Juliet.'

 Ay me!

 O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man.   O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain thy dear perfection which he owes
Without that title.   Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

 What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

 My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

 How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

 If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

 I would not for the world they saw thee here.

 By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

 Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me?   I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet, if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,
They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Of if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

 O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

 Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.

 Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by   summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

 What satisfaction canst thou have to. night?

 I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.

 But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.

Nurse calls within.
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse!   Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

Exit, above.
 Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

 I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--

 By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.

 A thousand times good night!

Exit, above.
 Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

 Romeo!

 At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?

 I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

 I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.

 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

 Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

Exit above.
 The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And   therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes!
Enter Nurse and PETER.
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him ?   Send thy man away.

 Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though the news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.

 I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

 How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either. and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

 No, no: but all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?

 I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

 Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'

 Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

 I have.

 Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
Exeunt
 Good even to my ghostly confessor.

 As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

 Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

 Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a waggoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Enter Nurse, with cords.
Now, nurse, what news?   What hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo did thee fetch?

 Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

 Can heaven be so envious?

 What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe,

 O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

 What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living if those two are gone?

 O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

 O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
When thou didst bower the spirit of fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound?   O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!

 Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

 Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentation might have moved?
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'
There is no end. no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

 Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords, come nurse; I'll to my weddingbed;
And death, not Romeo take my maidenhead!

 O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.

Exeunt.
 Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

 Yond light is not day-light, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet: thou, need'st not to be gone.

 It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes;
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

 Nurse?

 Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

 Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

 O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

 O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb;
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

 O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
That is renown'd for faith?   Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back.


 Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
Enter LADY CAPULET.
 Madam, I am not well.

 Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

 Feeling so the loss,
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

 What villain, madam?

 Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

 Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

 Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd:
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him named, and cannot come to him,
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!

 And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

 Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

 Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at his haste; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

 Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

 Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

 Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

 O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven   should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.

 Speakest thou from thy heart?

 Amen!

 Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolved.

 Ancient damnation!   O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times?   Go, counsellor;
Thou   and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

Exit.
 That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

 What must be shall be.

 To answer that, I should confess to you.

 I will confess to you that I love him.

 If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

 The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.

 That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

 It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

 O, shut the door and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

 Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

 O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless-skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

 Give me, give me!   O, tell not me of fear!

 Love give me strength and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!
Exeunt.
 Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

 I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.

 Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

 Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night;
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.
Enter LADY CAPULET.
 No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
In this so sudden business.

 Farewell!   God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold feat thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse!  What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
Laying down her dagger.
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, I should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That   living   mortals,   hearing   them,   run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefathers' joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
She falls upon her bed, within the curtains.
 O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
Noise within.
 Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Exit Fri. L. 
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after?   I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.
Kisses him.
Thy lips are warm.

 Yea, noise? then I'll be brief.   O happy dagger!
Snatching Romeo's dagger.
This is thy sheath Stabs herself ; there rust, and let me die.
Falls on Romeo's body, and dies.
Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS.
"
451,nurse.,Nurse to Juliet,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-nurse.," Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old.
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
God forbid!   Where's this girl?     What, Juliet!
Enter JULIET.
 Your mother.

  I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

 Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas--eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me; but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
'Shake' quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying and said, 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

 Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

 Peace, I have done.   God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once,
I have my wish.

 An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

 A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

 Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

 No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

 Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Exeunt. 
 Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

 Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous:
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.

 The son and heir of old Tiberio.

 Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

 I know not.

 His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.

 What's this? what's this?

 Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

Exeunt.
 Madam!

 Madam!

                Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark, you, sir.

 Is your man secret?   Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

     Peter, stay at the gate.
Exit Peter.
 I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

 Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?

  Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t'other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

  O God's lady dear!
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

 Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

 Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

 Ay, ay, the cords.

Throws them down.
 Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

 Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

 I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

 O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!

 Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

 It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

 There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!

 Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

 Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

 Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

 Let me come in, and you shall know my errand;
I come from Lady Juliet.

 O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

 O, he is even in my mistress's case,
Just in her case!   O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament!   Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, an you be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
Why should you fall into so deep an O?

 Ah sir! ah sir!   Well, death's the end of all.

 O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.

 O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

 Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

Exit.
 Madam

 Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary, look about.
Exit.
 God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

 I speak no treason.

 May not one speak?

 Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath.   Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.

 And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.

 What?

 Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
Exit. 
 Ay, forsooth.

 See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
Enter JULIET.
 They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Enter CAPULET.
 Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick tomorrow
For this night's watching.

 Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I must needs wake her.   Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed:
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
Undraws the curtains.
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
I must needs wake you:   Lady! lady! lady!
Alas, alas!   Help, help! my lady's dead!
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
Some aqua vita, ho!   My lord! my lady!
Enter LADY CAPULET.
 O lamentable day!

 Look, look! O heavy day!

 She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

 O lamentable day!

 O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day, O woful day!

 Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

Exit.

 The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain;
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Raise up the Mantagues: some others search:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.
Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR.
 Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE.
 A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
Enter the PRINCE and Attendants. 
 Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.

 Here is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo's man;
With instruments upon them, fit to open
These dead men's tombs.

460,king.,KING HENRY the Eighth,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-king.," My life itself, and the best heart of it,
Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level
Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks
To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us
That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person
I'll hear him his confessions justify;
And point by point the treasons of his master
He shall again relate.
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
Enter QUEEN KATHARINE, ushered by the DUKE OF NORFOLK,
and the DUKE OF SUFFOLK: she kneels.   The KING riseth from his state, takes her
up, kisses and placeth her by him.
 Arise, and take place by us: half your suit
Never name to us; you have half our power:
The other moiety, ere you ask, is given;
Repeat your will and take it.

 Lady mine, proceed.

 Taxation!
Wherein? and what taxation?   My lord cardinal,
You that are blamed for it alike with us,
Know you of this taxation?

 Still exaction!
The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,
Is this exaction?

 By my life,
This is against our pleasure.

 Things done well,
And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;
Things done without example, in their issue
Are to be fear'd.   Have you a precedent
Of this commission?   I believe, not any.
We must not rend our subjects from our laws,
And stick them in our will.   Sixth part of each?
A trembling contribution! Why, we take
From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber;
And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
The air will drink the sap. To every county
Where this is question'd send our letters, with
Free pardon to each man that has denied
The force of this commission: pray, look to't;
I put it to your care.

 It grieves many:
The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;
To nature none more bound; his training such,
That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,
And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,
When these so noble benefits shall prove
Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,
They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly
Than ever they were fair.   This man so complete,
Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,
Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find
His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,
Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
That once were his, and is become as black
As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--
This was his gentleman in trust--of him
Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
The fore-recited practices; whereof
We cannot feel too little, hear too much.

 Speak freely.

 Speak on:
How grounded he his title to the crown,
Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him
At any time speak aught?

 What was that Hopkins?

 How know'st thou this?

 Let him on.
Go forward.

 Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!
There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?

 Proceed.

 I remember
Of such a time: being my sworn servant,
The duke retain'd him his.   But on; what hence?

 A giant traitor!

 There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?

 There's his period,
To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;
Call him to present trial: if he may
Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none,
Let him not seek 't of us: by day and night,
He's traitor to the height.
Exeunt.
 The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,
Till now I never knew thee!
Music. Dance.
 Ye have found him, cardinal:

Unmasking.
You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:
You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,
I should judge now unhappily.

 My lord chamberlain,
Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?

 By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,
I were unmannerly, to take you out,
And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!
Let it go round.

 I fear, too much.

 Lead in your ladies, every one: sweet partner,
I must not yet forsake you: let's be merry,
Good my lord cardinal: I have half a dozen healths
To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure
To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream
Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.

Exeunt with trumpets.
 Who's there, ha?

 Who's there, I say?   How dare you thrust yourselves
Into my private meditations?
Who am I? ha?

 Ye are too bold:
Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:
Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?
Enter WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS, with a
                   commission. 
Who's there? my good lord cardinal?   O my Wolsey,
The quiet of my wounded conscience;
Thou art a cure fit for a king. [To Camp.]
You're welcome,
Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom:
Use us and it.   [To Wol.]
My good lord, have great care
I be not found a talker.

 We are busy; go.

 And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,
And thank the holy conclave for their loves:
They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.

 Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted
Forthwith for what you come.   Where's Gardiner?

 Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour
To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,
Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:
I find him a fit fellow.
[Exit Wolsey. Re-enter WOLSEY, with GARDINER.
 Come hither, Gardiner.

[Walks and whispers.
 Deliver this with modesty to the queen.
[Exit Gardiner. 
The most convenient place that I can think of
For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;
There ye shall meet about this weighty business.
My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,
Would it not grieve an able man to leave
So sweet a bedfellow?   But, conscience, conscience!
O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.

[Exeunt.
 What's the need?
It hath already publicly been read,
And on all sides the authority allow'd;
You may, then, spare that time.

 Here.

 Call her again.

 Go thy ways, Kate:
That man i' the world who shall report he has
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted,
For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,
If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,
Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,
Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,
The queen of earthly queens: she 's noble born;
And, like her true nobility, she has
Carried herself towards me.

 My lord cardinal,
I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,
I free you from 't. You are not to be taught
That you have many enemies, that know not
Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,
Bark when their fellows do: by some of these
The queen is put in anger. You're excused:
But will you be more justified? you ever
Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired
It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,
The passages made toward it: on my honour,
I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,
And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,
I will be bold with time and your attention:
Then mark the inducement.   Thus it came; give heed to't:
My conscience first received a tenderness,
Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd
By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;
Who had been hither sent on the debating
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,
Ere a determinate resolution, he,
I mean the bishop, did require a respite;
Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
Whether our daughter were legitimate,
Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
Sometimes our brother's wife.   This respite shook
The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,
Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble
The region of my breast; which forced such way,
That many mazed considerings did throng
And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had
Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,
If it conceived a male child by me, should
Do no more offices of life to 't than
The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
Or died where they were made, or shortly after
This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,
This was a judgement on me; that my kingdom,
Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not
Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that
I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me
Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
Now present here together; that's to say,
I meant to rectify my conscience,--which
I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--
By all the reverend fathers of the land
And doctors learn'd: first I began in private
With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember
How under my oppression I did reek,
When I first moved you.

 I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say
How far you satisfied me.

 I then moved you,
My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave
To make this present summons: unsolicited
I left no reverend person in this court;
But by particular consent proceeded
Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on;
For no dislike i' the world against the person
Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:
Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life
And kingly dignity, we are contented
To wear our mortal state to come with her,
Katharine our queen, before the primest creature
That's paragon'd o' the world.

 I may perceive
These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor
This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,
Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,
My comfort comes along. Break up the court:
I say, set on.

[Exeunt in manner as they entered.
 What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
To his own portion! and what expense by the hour
Seems to flow from him!   How, i' the name of thrift,
Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
Saw you the cardinal?

 It may well be;
There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning
Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
As I required: and wot you what I found
There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?
Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;
The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks
Possession of a subject.

 If we did think
His contemplation were above the earth,
And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still
Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
His serious considering.

King takes his seat; whispers Lowell, who
 goes to the Cardinal.
 Good my lord,
You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
Of your best graces in your mind; the which
You were now running o'er: you have scarce time
To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that
I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
To have you therein my companion.

 You have said well.

 'Tis well said again;
And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:
And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:
He said he did; and with his deed did crown
His word upon you. Since I had my office,
I have kept you next my heart, have not alone
Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
But pared my present havings, to bestow
My bounties upon you.

 Have I not made you
The prime man of the state?   I pray you, tell me,
If what I now pronounce you have found true:
And, if you may confess it, say withal,
If you are bound to us or no. What say you?

 Fairly answer'd;
A loyal and obedient subject is
Therein illustrated: the honour of it
Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,
The foulness is the punishment. I presume
That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,
My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour more
On you than any; so your hand and heart,
Your brain, and every function of your power,
Should, notwithstanding   that your bond of duty,
As 'twere in love's particular, be more
To me, your friend, than any.

 'Tis nobly spoken:
Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,
For you have seen him open't.   Read o'er this;
Giving him papers. 
And after, this: and then to breakfast with
What appetite you have.

Exit King, frowning upon Cardinal Wolsey: the nobles throng after
             him, smiling and whispering.
 Charles, I will play no more to-night;
My mind's not on 't; you are too hard for me.

 But little, Charles;
Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.
Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?

 What say'st thou, ha?
To pray for her? what, is she crying out?

 Alas, good lady!

 'Tis midnight, Charles;
Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers remember
The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;
For I must think of that which company
Would not be friendly to.

 Charles, good night.
Exit Suffolk.Enter SIR ANTHONY DENNY. 
Well, sir, what follows?

 Ha! Canterbury?

 'Tis true: where is he, Denny?

 Bring him to us.

Exit Denny.
 Avoid the gallery.   [Lovell seems to stay.]
Ha! I have said. Be gone.
What!
[Exeunt Lovell and Denny.
 How now, my lord! you do desire to know
Wherefore I sent for you.

 Pray you, arise,
My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
Come, you and I must walk a turn together;
I have news to tell you: come, come, give me your hand.
Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,
And am right sorry to repeat what follows:
I have, and most unwillingly, of late
Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,
Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,
Have moved us and our council, that you shall
This morning come before us; where, I know,
You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,
But that, till further trial in those charges
Which will require your answer, you must take
Your patience to you, and be well contented
To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,
It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness
Would come against you.

 Stand up, good Canterbury:
Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted
In us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up:
Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame,
What manner of man are you?   My lord, I look'd
You would have given me your petition, that
I should have ta'en some pains to bring together
Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,
Without indurance, further.

 Know you not
How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?
Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices
Must bear the same proportion; and not ever
The justice and the truth o' the question carries
The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease
Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
To swear against you? such things have been done.
You are potently opposed; and with a malice
Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,
Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived
Upon this naughty earth?   Go to, go to;
You take a precipice for no leap of danger,
And woo your own destruction.

 Be of good cheer;
They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
Keep comfort to you; and this morning see
You do appear before them: if they shall chance,
In charging you with matters, to commit you,
The best persuasions to the contrary
Fail not to use, and with what vehemency
The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties
Will render you no remedy, this ring
Deliver them, and your appeal to us
There make before them.   Look, the good man weeps!
He's honest, on mine honour.   God's blest mother!
I swear he is true-hearted; and a soul
None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,
And do as I have bid you. [Exit Cranmer.]
He has strangled
His language in his tears.
Enter Old Lady, LOVELL following.
 Now, by thy looks
I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?
Say, ay; and of a boy.

 Lovell!

 Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.
[Exit. 
 What's that, Butts?

 Body o' me, where is it?

 Ha! 'tis he, indeed:
Is this the honour they do one another?
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
They had parted so much honesty among 'em,
At least, good manners, as not thus to suffer
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,
And at the door too, like a post with packets.
By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:
Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
We shall hear more anon.
Exeunt.
 You were ever good at sudden commendations.
Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not
To hear such flattery now, and in my presence;
They are too thin and bare to hide offences.
To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sure
Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.
[To Cranmer]
Good man, sit down.   Now let me see the proudest
He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:
By all that's holy, he had better starve
Than but once think this place becomes thee not.

 No, sir, it does not please me.
I had thought I had had men of some understanding
And wisdom of my council; but I find none.
Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,
This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--
This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
At chamber-door? and one as great as you are?
Why, what a shame was this!   Did my commission
Bid ye so far forget yourselves?   I gave ye
Power as he was a counsellor to try him,
Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,
More out of malice than integrity,
Would try him to the utmost had ye mean;
Which ye shall never have while I live.

 Well, well, my lords, respect him;
Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it,
I will say thus much for him, if a prince
May be beholding to a subject, I
Am, for his love and service, so to him.
Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:
Be friends, for shame, my lords!   My Lord of Canterbury,
I have a suit which you must not deny me;
That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,
You must be godfather, and answer for her.

 Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,
Embrace and love this man.

 Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:
The common voice, I see, is verified
Of thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of Canterbury
A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.'
Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long
To have this young one made a Christian.
As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;
So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.

[Exeunt.
 Thank you, good lord archbishop:
What is her name?

 Stand up, lord.

[The King kisses the child.
With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!
Into whose hand I give thy life.

 My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:
I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,
When she has so much English.

 Thou speakest wonders.

 O lord archbishop,
Thou hast made me now a man! never, before
This happy child, did I get any thing:
This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,
That when I am in heaven I shall desire
To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,
And your good brethren, I am much beholding;
I have received much honour by your presence,
And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:
Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,
She will be sick else. This day, no man think
Has business at his house; for all shall stay:
This little one shall make it holiday.
[Exeunt.
"
461,wol.,CARDINAL WOLSEY,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-wol.," The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?
Where's his examination?

 Is he in person ready?

 Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham
Shall lessen this big look.

Exeunt Wolsey and his Train.
 Please you, sir,
I know but of a single part, in aught
Pertains to the state; and front but in that file
Where others tell steps with me.

 And for me,
I have no further gone in this than by
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
By learned approbation of the judges. If I am
Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know
My faculties nor person, yet will be
The chronicles of my doing, let me say
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
That virtue must go through.   We must not stint
Our necessary actions, in the fear
To cope malicious censurers; which ever,
As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow
That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further
Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,
By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is
Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,
Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
For our best act. If we shall stand still,
In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,
We should take root here where we sit, or sit
State-statues only.

 A word with you.

[To the Secretary.
Let there be letters writ to every shire,
Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons
Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised
That through our intercession this revokement
And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you
Further in the proceeding.
[Exit Secretary.
Enter Surveyor.
 Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,
Most like a careful subject, have collected
Out of the Duke of Buckingham.

 Please your highness, note
This dangerous conception in this point.
Not friended by his wish, to your high person
His will is most malignant; and it stretches
Beyond you, to your friends.

 Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,
And this man out of prison?

 You're welcome, my fair guests: that noble lady,
Or gentleman, that is not freely merry,
Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;
And to you all, good health.
Drinks.
 My Lord Sands,
I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.
Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,
Whose fault is this?

 What's that?

 What warlike voice,
And to what end, is this?   Nay, ladies, fear not;
By all the laws of war you're privileged.
Re-enter Servant.
 Good lord chamberlain,
Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;
And, pray, receive 'em nobly, and conduct 'em
Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty
Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.

Exit Chamberlain, attended. All rise,
and tables removed.
You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.
A good digestion to you all: and once more
I shower a welcome on ye; welcome all.
Hautboys. Enter the KING and others, as
   masquers, habited like shepherds, ushered
   by the LORD CHAMBERLAIN.   They pass
   directly before the CARDINAL, and gracefully salute him. 
A noble company! what are their pleasures?

 Say, lord chamberlain,
They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.

They choose Ladies for the dance. The King chooses Anne Bullen.
 My lord!

 Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:
There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,
More worthy this place than myself; to whom,
If I but knew him, with my love and duty
I would surrender it.

 What say they?

 Let me see, then.
By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make
My royal choice.

 I am glad
Your grace is grown so pleasant.

 Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready
I' the privy chamber?

 Your grace,
I fear, with dancing is a little heated.

 There's fresher air, my lord,
In the next chamber.

 Sir, you cannot.
I would your grace would give us but an hour
Of private conference.

 Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom
Above all princes, in committing freely
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:
Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?
The Spaniard, tied by blood and favour to her,
Must now confess, if they have any goodness,
The trial just and noble. All the clerks,
I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms
Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgement,
Invited by your noble self, hath sent
One general tongue unto us, this good man,
This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;
Whom once more I present unto your highness.

 I know your majesty has always loved her
So dear in heart, not to deny her that
A woman of less place might ask by law:
Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.

 Give me your hand: must joy and favour to you;
You are the king's now.

 Yes, he was.

 Yes, surely.

 How! of me?

 Heaven's peace be with him!
That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers
There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;
For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,
If I command him, follows my appointment:
I will have none so near else.   Learn this, brother,
We live not to be griped by meaner persons.

 Whilst our commission from Rome is read,
Let silence be commanded.

 Be 't so. Proceed.

 You have here, lady.
And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men
Of singular integrity and learning,
Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled
To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless
That longer you desire the court; as well
For your own quiet, as to rectify
What is unsettled in the king.

 Your pleasure, madam?

 Be patient yet.

 I do profess
You speak not like yourself; who ever yet
Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects
Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom
O'ertopping woman's power.   Madam, you do me wrong:
I have no spleen against you; nor injustice
For you or any: how far I have proceeded,
Or how far further shall, is warranted
By a commission from the consistory,
Yea, the whole consistory of Rome.   You charge me
That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:
The king is present: if it be known to him
That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,
And worthily, my falsehood!   yea, as much
As you have done my truth. If he know
That I am free of your report, he knows
I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to
Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
His highness shall speak in, I do beseech
You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking
And to say so no more.

 Most gracious sir,
In humblest manner I require your highness,
That it shall please you to declare, in hearing
Of all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,
There must I be unloosed, although not there
At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I
Did broach this business to your highness; or
Laid any scruple in your way, which might
Induce you to the question on 't? or ever
Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
Be to the prejudice of her present state,
Or touch of her good person?

 Peace to your highness!

 May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw
Into your private chamber, we shall give you
The full cause of our coming.

 Tanta est erga te mentis integritas,
regina serenissima,--

 Noble lady,
I am sorry my integrity should breed,
And service to his majesty and you,
So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.
We come not by the way of accusation,
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,
You have too much, good lady; but to know
How you stand minded in the weighty difference
Between the king and you; and to deliver,
Like free and honest men, our just opinions
And comforts to your cause.

 Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:
Your hopes and friends are infinite.

 He tells you rightly.

 Madam, this is a mere distraction;
You turn the good we offer into envy.

 Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.

 Pray, hear me.

 If your grace
Could be brought to know our ends are honest,
You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,
Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,
The way of our profession is against it:
We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.
For goodness' sake, consider what you do;
How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly
Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.
The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
I know you have a gentle, noble temper,
A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us
Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.

 The packet, Cromwell,
Gave't you the king?

 Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?

 Is he ready
To come abroad?

 Leave me awhile.
[Exit Cromwell.
[Aside]
It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,
The French king's sister: he shall marry her.
Anne Bullen!   No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:
There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!
No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish
To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!

 The late queen's gentle, woman, a knight's daughter,
To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!
This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;
Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous
And well deserving? yet I know her for
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of
Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up
An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one
Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,
And is his oracle.

 Heaven forgive me!
Ever God bless your highness!

 Sir,
For holy offices I have a time; a time
To think upon the part of business which
I bear i' the state; and nature does require
Her times of preservation, which perforce
I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,
Must give my tendance to.

 And ever may your highness yoke together,
As I will lend you cause, my doing well
With my well saying!

 What should this mean?

 My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,
Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could
My studied purposes requite; which went
Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours
Have ever come too short of my desires,
Yet filled with my abilities: mine own ends
Have been mine so that ever more they pointed
To the good of your most sacred person and
The profit of the state. For your great graces
Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I
Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,
My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,
Which ever has and ever shall be growing,
Till death, that winter, kill it.

 I do profess
That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
More than mine own; tthat am, have, and will be--
Though all the world should crack their duty to you,
And throw it from their soul; though perils did
Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and
Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,
As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
Should the approach of this wild river break,
And stand unshaken yours.

 What should this mean?
What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?
He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion
Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;
Then makes him   nothing.   I must read this paper;
I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
This paper has undone me: 'tis the account
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedome,
And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!
Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil
Made me put this main secret in the packet
I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
No new device to beat this from his brains?
I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune
Will bring me off again. What's this?   'To the Pope!'
The letter, as I live, with all the business
I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;
And, from that full meridian of my glory,
I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
Like a bright exhalation in the evening.
And no man see me more.
Re-enter to WOLSEY, the DUKES OF NORFOLK
   and SUFFOLK, the EARL OF SURREY, and
   the LORD CHAMBERLAIN.
 Stay:
Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry
Authority so weighty.

 Till I find more than will or words to do it,
I mean your malice, know, officious lords,
I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:
How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,
As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton
Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!
Follow your envious courses, men of malice;
You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,
In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,
You ask with such a violence, the king,
Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;
Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,
During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,
Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?

 It must be himself, then.

 Proud lord, thou liest:
Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
Have burnt that tongue than said so.

 This, and all else
This talking lord can lay upon my credit,
I answer is most false. The duke by law
Found his deserts: how innocent I was
From any private malice in his end,
His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you
You have as little honesty as honour,
That in the way of loyalty and truth
Toward the king, my ever royal master,
Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,
And all that love his follies.

 All goodness
Is poison to thy stomach.

 How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
But that I am bound in charity against it!

 So much fairer
And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
When the king knows my truth.

 Speak on, sir;
I dare your worst objections: if I blush,
It is to see a nobleman want manners.

 So farewell to the little good you bear me.
Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
This many summers in a sea of glory,
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
At length broke under me and now has left me,
Weary and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:
I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretch'd
Is that poor man   that hangs on princes' favours!
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
More pangs and fears than wars or women have:
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again.
Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed.
Why, how now, Cromwell!

 What, amazed
At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder
A great man should decline?   Nay, an you weep,
I am fall'n indeed.

 Why, well;
Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
I know myself now; and I feel within me
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,
I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,
These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken
A load would sink a navy, too much honour:
O, 'tis a burden, Cromwell, 'tis a burden
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!

 I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
To endure more miseries and greater far
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
What news abroad?

 God bless him!

 That's somewhat sudden,
But he's a learned man. May he continue
Long in his highness' favour, and do justice
For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,
May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on 'em!
What more?

 That's news indeed.

 There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,
The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
In that one woman I have lost for ever:
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,
Or gild again the noble troops that waited
Upon my smiles.   Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;
I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now
To be thy lord and master: seek the king;
That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
Some little memory of me will stir him--
I know his noble nature--not to let
Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,
Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
For thine own future safety.

 Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,
Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.
Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
Corruption wins not more than honesty.
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell,
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;
And,--prithee, lead me in:
There take an inventory of all I have,
To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,
And my integrity to heaven, is all
I dare now call mine own.   O Cromwell, Cromwell!
Had I but served my God with half the zeal
I served my king, he would not in mine age
Have left me naked to mine enemies.

 So I have. Farewell
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.
[Exeunt. 
"
462,cam.,CARDINAL CAMPEIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-cam.," Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,
You are so noble. To your highness' hand
I tender my commission; by whose virtue
The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord
Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant
In the unpartial judging of this business.

 My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace
In this man's place before him?

 Was he not held a learned man?

 Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then
Even of yourself, lord cardinal.

 They will not stick to say you envied him,
And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,
Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him,
That he ran mad and died.

 His grace
Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,
It's fit this royal session do proceed;
And that, without delay, their arguments
Be now produced and heard.

 The queen is obstinate,
Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and
Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
She's going away.

 So please your highness,
The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness
That we adjourn this court till further day:
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
Made to the queen, to call back her appeal
She intends unto his holiness.

 Most honour'd madam,
My lord of York, out of his noble nature,
Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,
Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure
Both of his truth and him, which was too far,
Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
His service and his counsel.

 I would your grace
Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.

 Put your main cause into the king's protection;
He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much
Both for your honour better and your cause;
For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,
You'll part away disgraced.

 Your rage mistakes us.

 Your fears are worse.

 Madam, you'll find it so.  You wrong your virtues
With these weak women's fears; a noble spirit,
As yours was put into you, ever casts
Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;
Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please
To trust us in your business, we are ready
To use our utmost studies in your service.

"
463,cap.,CAPUCIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-cap.," Madam, the same; your servant.

 Noble lady,
First, mine own service to your grace; the next,
The king's request that I would visit you;
Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
Sends you his princely commendations,
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.

 Madam, in good health.

 Most willingly, madam.

 By heaven, I will,

464,cran.,CRANMER,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-cran.," I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.

 It is my duty
To attend your highness' pleasure.

 I humbly thank your highness;
And am right glad to catch this good occasion
Most thoroughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff
And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,
There's none stands under more calumnious tongues
Than I myself, poor man.

 Most dread liege,
The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:
If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,
Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,
Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing
What can be said against me.

 God and your majesty
Protect mine innocence, or I fall into
The trap is laid for me!

 I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,
That was sent to me from the council, pray'd me
To make great haste. All fast? what means this?   Ho!
Who waits there?   Sure, you know me?
Enter Keeper.
 Why?
Enter DOCTOR BUTTS.
 So.

 'Tis Butts,
The king's physician: as he pass'd along,
How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!
Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace! For certain,
This is of purpose laid by some that hate me--
God turn their hearts!   I never sought their malice--
To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me
Wait else at door, a fellow-counsellor,
'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys.   But their pleasures
Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.
Enter the KING and BUTTS at a window
above.
 My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress
Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,
And with no little study, that my teaching
And the strong course of my authority
Might go one way, and safely; and the end
Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,
I speak it with a single heart, my lords,
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
Both in his private conscience and his place,
Defacers of a public peace, than I do.
Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart
With less allegiance in it! Men that make
Envy and crooked malice nourishment
Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,
That, in this case of justice, my accusers,
Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
And freely urge against me.

 Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;
You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,
You are so merciful: I see your end;
'Tis my undoing; love and meekness, lord,
Become a churchman better than ambition:
Win straying souls with modesty again,
Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,
I make as little doubt, as you do conscience
In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
But reverence   to your calling makes me modest.

 Is there no other way of mercy,
But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?

 For me?
Must I go like a traitor thither?

 Stay, good my lords,
I have a little yet to say.   Look there, my lords;
By virtue of that ring, I take my cause
Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it
To a most noble judge, the king my master.

 The greatest monarch now alive may glory
In such an honour: how may I deserve it,
That am a poor and humble subject to you?

 And let heaven
Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.

 And to your royal grace, and the good queen,
My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:
All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,
Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,
May hourly fall upon ye!

 Elizabeth.

 Amen.

 Let me speak, sir,
For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.
This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--
Though in her cradle, yet now promises
Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be
But few now living can behold that goodness--
A pattern to all princes living with her,
And all that shall succeed: Saba was never
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,
With all the virtues that attend the good,
Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:
She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:
In her days every man shall eat in safety,
Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
The merry songs of peace to all his nighbours:
God shall be truly known; and those about her
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,
And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Her ashes new create another heir,
As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
That were the servants to this chosen infant,
Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
His honour and the greatness of his name
Shall be, and make new   nations: he shall flourish,
And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches
To all the plains about him: our children's children
Shall see this, and bless heaven.

 She shall be, to the happiness of England,
An aged princess; many days shall see her,
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
Would I had known no more! but she must die,
She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
A most unspotted fly shall she pass
To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.

"
465,nor.,DUKE OF NORFOLK,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-nor.," I thank your grace,
Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer
Of what I saw there.

 'Twixt Guynes and Arde:
I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;
Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung
In their embracement, as they grew together;
Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd
Such a compounded one?

 Then you lost
The view of earthly glory: men might say,
Till this time pomp was single, but now married
To one above itself. Each following day
Became the next day's master, till the last
Made former wonders its.   To-day the French,
All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they
Made Britain India: every man that stood
Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
As cherubins, all gilt: the madams too,
Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
The pride upon them, that their very labour
Was to them as a painting: now this masque
Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night
Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
As presence did present them; him in eye,
Still him in praise: and, being present both,
Twas said they saw   but one; and no discerner
Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged
The noble spirits to arms, they did perform
Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,
Being now seen possible enough, got credit,
That Bevis was believed.

 As I belong to worship and affect
In honour honesty, the tract of every thing
Would by a good discourser lose some life,
Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;
To the disposing of it nought rebell'd,
Order gave each thing view; the office did
Distinctly his full function.

 One, certes, that promises no element
In such a business.

 All this was order'd by the good discretion
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.

 Surely, sir,
There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace
Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon
For high feats done to the crown; neither allied
To eminent assistants; but, spider-like,
Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,
The force of his own merit makes his way;
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys
A place next to the king.

 Grievingly I think,
The peace between the French and us not values
The cost that did conclude it.

 Which is budded out;
For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd
Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.

 Marry, is't.

 Like it your grace,
The state takes notice of the private difference
Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Honour and plenteous safety--that you read
The cardinal's malice and his potency
Together; to consider further that
What his high hatred would effect wants not
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
That he's revengeful, and I know his sword
Math a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,
It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,
You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
That I advise your shunning.
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne
 before him, certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with papers.
The CARDINAL in his passage fixeth his eye on BUCKINGHAM,
and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdain.
 What, are you chafed?
Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only
Which your disease requires.

 Stay, my lord,
And let your reason with your choler question
What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
Requires slow pace at first: anger is like
A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
Can advise me like you: be to yourself
As you would to your friend.

 Be advised;
Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,
By violent swiftness, that which we run at,
And lose by over-running. Know you not,
That fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er,
In seeming to augment it wastes it?   Be advised:
I say again, there is no English soul
More stronger to direct you than yourself,
If with the sap of reason you would quench,
Or but allay, the fire of passion.

 Say not 'treasonous.'

 Faith, and so it did.

 I am sorry
To hear this of him; and could wish he were
Something mistaken in't.

 Not almost appears,
It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,
The clothiers all, not able to maintain
The many to them 'longing, have put off
The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,
Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger
And lack of other means, in desperate manner
Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,
And danger serves among them.

 Well met, my lord chamberlain.

 What's the cause?

 'Tis so:
This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:
That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,
Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.

 How holily he works in all his business!
And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league
Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,
He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters
Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,
Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:
And out of all these to restore the king,
He counsels a divorce; a loss of her
That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years
About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;
Of her that loves him with that excellence
That angels love good men with; even of her
That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?

 We had need pray,
And heartily, for our deliverance;
Or this imperious man will work us all
From princes into pages: all men's honours
Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd
Into what pitch he please.

 Let's in;
And with some other business put the king
From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:
My lord, you'll bear us company?

 Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.

Exit Lord Chamberlain; and the
 King draws the curtain, and sits reading pensively. 
 Pray God he be not angry.

 A gracious king that pardons all offences
Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way
Is business of estate; in which we come
To know your royal pleasure.

 This priest has no pride in him?

 If it do,
I'll venture one have-at-him.

 If you will now unite in your complaints,
And force them with a constancy, the cardinal
Cannot stand under them: if you omit
The offer of this time, I cannot promise
But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,
With these you bear already.

 O, fear him not;
His spell in that is out: the king hath found
Matter against him that for ever mars
The honey of his language. No, he's settled,
Not to come off, in his displeasure.

 Believe it, this is true:
In the divorce his contrary proceedings
Are all unfolded; wherein he appears
As I would wish mine enemy.

 All men's!

 Marry, amen!

 But, my lord,
When returns Cranmer?

 This same Cranmer's
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
In the king's business.

 So I hear.

 Observe, observe, he's moody.

 He's discontented.

 He is vex'd at something.

 My lord, we have
Stood here observing him; some strange commotion
Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;
Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
Then lays his finger on his temple; straight
Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,
Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts
His eye against the moon: in most strange postures
We have seen him set himself.

 It's heaven's will:
Some spirit put this paper in the packet,
To bless your eye withal.

 Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you
To render up the great seal presently
Into our hands; and to confine yourself
To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,
Till you hear further from his highness.

 Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:
But, thus much, they are foul ones.

 Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else
To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'
Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king
To be your servant.

 And so we'll leave you to your meditations
How to live better. For your stubborn answer
About the giving back the great seal to us,
The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.

Exeunt all but Wolsey.
 Who waits there?

 Do you think, my lords,
The king will suffer but the little finger
Of this man to be vex'd?

"
466,buck.,DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-buck.," Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
Since last we saw in France?

 An untimely ague
Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
Met in the vale of Andren.

 All the whole time
I was my chamber's prisoner.

 O, you go far.

 Who did guide,
I mean, who set the body and the limbs
Of this great sport together, as you guess?

 I pray you, who, my lord?

 The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed
From his ambitious finger. What had he
To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
That such a keech can with his very bulk
Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun
And keep it from the earth.

 Why the devil,
Upon this French going out, took he upon him,
Without the privity o' the king, to appoint
Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
Of all the gentry; for the most part such
To whom as great a charge as little honour
He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,
The honourable board of council out,
Must fetch him in the papers.

 O, many
Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
For this great journey. What did this vanity
But minister communication of
A most poor issue?

 Every man,
After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke
Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,
Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
The sudden breach on't.

 Why, all this business
Our reverend cardinal carried.

 This butcher's cur is venommouth'd, and I
Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
Not wake him in his slumber.   A beggar's book
Outworths a noble's blood.

 I read in's looks
Matter against me; and his eye reviled
Me, as his abject object: at this instant
He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;
I'll follow and outstare him.

 I'll to the king;
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim
There's difference in no persons.

 Sir,
I am thankful to you; and I'll go along
By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,
Whom from the flow of gall I name not but
From sincere motions, by intelligence,
And proofs as clear as founts in July when
We see each grain of gravel, I do know
To be corrupt and treasonous.

 To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong
As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous
As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
As able to perform't; his mind and place
Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--
Only to show his pomp as well in France
As here at home, suggests the king our master
To this last costly treaty, the interview
That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass
Did break i' the rinsing.

 Pray, give me favour, sir.   This cunning cardinal
The articles o' the combination drew
As himself pleased; and they were ratified
As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end
As give a crutch to the dead: but our countcardinal
Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,
Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--
Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,
Under pretence to see the queen his aunt,--
For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came
To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:
His fears were, that the interview betwixt
England and France might, through their amity,
Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily
Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--
Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor
Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted
Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,
That he would please to alter the king's course,
And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,
As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,
And for his own advantage.

 No, not a syllable:
I do pronounce him in that very shape
He shall appear in proof.
Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-Arms before him, and two or three of the Guard. 
 Lo, you, my lord,
The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
Under device and practice.

 It will help me nothing
To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me,
Which makes my whitest part black.   The will of heaven
Be done in this and all things! I obey.
O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!

 So, so;
These are the limbs o' the pot: no more, I hope.

 O, Nicholas Hopkins?

 My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal
Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,
By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.
Exeunt. 
 All good people,
You that thus far have come to pity me,
Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
I have this day received a traitor's judgement,
And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,
And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,
Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
The law I bear no malice for my death;
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:
Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;
For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
For further life in this world I ne'er hope,
Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies
More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
Is only bitter to him, only dying,
Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,
And lift my soul to heaven.   Lead on, o' God's name.

 Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;
There cannot be those numberless offences
'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with: no black envy
Shall mark my grave.   Commend me to his grace;
And, if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him
You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers
Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,
Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live
Longer than I have time to tell his years!
Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!
And when old time shall lead him to his end,
Goodness and he fill up one monument!

 Nay, Sir Nicholas,
Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
When I came hither, I was lord high constable
And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:
Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;
And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for 't.
My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
Who first raised head against usurping Richard,
Flying for succour to his servant Banister,
Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,
And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,
Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
That made me happy at one stroke has taken
For ever from the world. I had my trial,
And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me
A little happier than my wretched father:
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;
A most unnatural and faithless service!
Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,
This from a dying man receive as certain:
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
Like water from ye, never found again
But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
Pray for me!   I must now forsake ye: the last hour
Of my long weary life is come upon me.
Farewell:
And when you would say something that is sad,
Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!
Exeunt Duke and Train. 
"
467,suf.,DUKE OF SUFFOLK,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-suf.," How is the king employ'd?

 No, his conscience
Has crept too near another lady.

 Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.

 And free us from his slavery.

 For me, my lords,
I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:
As I am made without him, so I'll stand,
If the king please; his curses and his blessings
Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.
I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him
To him that made him proud, the pope.

 How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.

 Not to speak of:
I would not be so sick though for his place:
But this cannot continue.

 I another.

Exeunt Nor. and Suf.
 Which of the peers
Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
Strangely neglected? when did he regard
The stamp of nobleness in any person
Out of himself?

 Most strangely.

 The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,
And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,
How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
To stay the judgement o' the divorce; for if
It did take place, 'I do,' quoth he, 'perceive
My king is tangled in affection to
A creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'

 Believe it.

 May you be happy in your wish, my lord!
For, I profess, you have it.

 My amend to 't!

 There's order given for her coronation:
Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left
To some ears unrecounted.   But, my lords,
She is a gallant creature, and complete
In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her
Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall
In it be memorized.

 No, no;
There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
Will make this sting the sooner.   Cardinal Campeius
Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;
Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and
Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,
To second all his plot. I do assure you
The king cried Ha! at this.

 He is return'd in his opinions: which
Have satisfied the king for his divorce,
Together with all famous colleges
Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,
His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
Her coronation. Katharine no more
Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager
And widow to Prince Arthur.

 He has; and we shall see him
For it an archbishop.

 'Tis so.
The cardinal! Enter WOLSEY and CROMWELL.
 May be, he hears the king
Does whet his anger to him.

 The king, the king!

 Who dare cross 'em,
Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?

 Then that, without the knowledge
Either of king or council, when you went
Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold
To carry into Flanders the great seal.

 That, out of mere ambition, you have caused
Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.

 Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,
Because all those things you have done of late,
By your power legatine, within this kingdom,
Fall into the compass of a praemunire,
That therefore such a writ be sued against you;
To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
Out of the king's protection.   This is my charge.

 Sir, I did never win of you before.

 God safely quit her of her burthen, and
With gentle travail, to the gladding of
Your highness with an heir!

 I wish your highness
A quiet night; and my good mistress will
Remember in my prayers.

 Nay, my lord,
That cannot be: you are a counsellor,
And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.

 'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,
When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,
'Twould fall upon ourselves.

"
468,sur.,EARL OF SURREY,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-sur.," I am joyful
To meet the least occasion that may give me
Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,
To be revenged on him.

 Sir,
I should be glad to hear such news as this
Once every hour.

 How came
His practices to light?

 O, how, how?

 Has the king this?

 Will this work?

 Would he had!

 Now, all my joy
Trace the conjunction!

 But, will the king
Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
The Lord forbid!

 Sharp enough,
Lord, for thy justice!

 I would 'twere something that would fret the string,
The master-cord on's heart!
Enter the KING, reading of a schedule, and
                                   LOVELL.
 The Lord increase this business!

 The king, that gave it.

 Thou art a proud traitor, priest.

 Thy ambition,
Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land
Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:
The heads of all thy brother cardinals,
With thee and all thy best parts bound together,
Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
You sent me deputy for Ireland;
Far from his succour, from the king, from all
That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;
Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
Absolved him with an axe.

 By my soul,
Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou shouldst feel
My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,
Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,
To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,
Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,
And dare us with his cap like larks.

 Yes, that goodness
Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,
Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;
The goodness of your intercepted packets
You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,
Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.
My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,
As you respect the common good, the state
Of our despised nobility, our issues,
Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,
Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
Collected from his life. I'll startle you
Worse than the sacring bell, when the brown wench
Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.

 This cannot save you:
I thank my memory, I yet remember
Some of these articles; and out they shall.
Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,
You'll show a little honesty.

 I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,
You wrought to be a legate; by which power
You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.

 Item, you sent a large commission
To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,
Without the king's will or the state's allowance,
A league between his highness and Ferrara.

 Then that you have sent innumerable substance--
By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--
To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways
You have for dignities: to the mere undoing
Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;
Which, since they are of you, and odious,
I will not taint my mouth with.

 I forgive him.

 'Tis no counterfeit,

 May it please your grace,--

"
469,cham.,Lord Chamberlain,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-cham.," Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
Men into such strange mysteries?

 As far as I see, all the good our English
Have got by the late voyage is but merely
A fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;
For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly
Their very noses had been counsellors
To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.

 Death! my lord,
Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,
That, sure, they've worn out Christendom.
Enter SIR THOMAS LOVELL.
How now!
What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?

 What is't for?

 I'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs
To think an English courtier may be wise,
And never see the Louvre.

 What a loss our ladies
Will have of these trim vanities!

 Well said, Lord Sands;
Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.

 Sir Thomas,
Whither were you a-going?

 O, 'tis true:
This night he makes a supper, and a great one,
To many lords and ladies; there will be
The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.

 No doubt he's noble;
He had a black mouth that said other of him.

 True, they are so;
But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;
Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,
We shall be late else; which I would not be,
For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford
This night to be comptrollers.

 You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.

 Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,
Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:
His grace is entering.   Nay, you must not freeze;
Two women placed together makes cold weather:
My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;
Pray, sit between these ladies.

 Well said, my lord.
So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,
The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies
Pass away frowning.

 Look out there, some of ye.

Exit Servant.
 How now! what is't?

 Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd
To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame
Of this so noble and so fair assembly
This night to meet here, they could do no less,
Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,
But leave their flocks; and, under your fair conduct,
Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
An hour of revels with 'em.

 Your grace?

 I will, my lord.

Whispers the Masquers.
 Such a one, they all confess,
There is indeed; which they would have your grace
Find out, and he will take it.

 An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter,--
The Viscount Rochford,--one of her highness women.

 I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:
He will have all, I think.
Enter, to the LORD CHAMBERLAIN, the DUKES
OF NORFOLK and SUFFOLK.
 Good day to both your graces.

 I left him private,
Full of sad thoughts and troubles.

 It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
Has crept too near his conscience.

 Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true
These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,
And every true heart weeps for 't: all that dare
Look into these affairs see this main end,
The French king's sister.   Heaven will one day open
The king's eyes, that so long have slept upon
This bold bad man.

 Excuse me;
The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,
You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:
Health to your lordships.

 Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know
The secret of your conference?

 It was a gentle business, and becoming
The action of good women: there is hope
All will be well.

 You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings
Follow such creatures.   That you may, fair lady,
Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's
Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty
Commends his good opinion of you, and
Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
Than Marchioness of Pembroke; to which title
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
Out of his grace he adds.

 Lady,
I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
The king hath of you.   [Aside]
I have perused her well;
Beauty and honour in her are so mingled
That they have caught the king: and who knows yet
But from this lady may proceed a gem
To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,
And say I spoke with you.

[Exit Lord Chamberlain.
 My lords, you speak your pleasures:
What he deserves of you and me I know;
What we can do to him, though now the time
Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot
Bar his access to the king, never attempt
Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft
Over the king in's tongue.

 The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
And hedges his own way. But in this point
All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic
After his patient's death: the king already
Hath married the fair lady.

 Now, God incense him,
And let him cry Ha! louder!

 O my lord,
Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:
His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him
So little of his great self.

 This is the king's ring.

 Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!
They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,
As if we kept a fair here!   Where are these porters,
These lazy knaves?   Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:
There's a trim rabble let in: are all these
Your faithful friends o' the suburbs?   We shall have
Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,
When they pass back from the christening.

 As I live,
If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all
By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads
Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;
And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
Ye should do service.   Hark! the trumpets sound;
They're come already from the christening:
Go, break among the press, and find a way out
To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.

"
470,chan.,Lord Chancellor,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-chan.," Speak to the business, master secretary:
Why are we met in council?

 Let him come in.

 My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry
To sit here at this present and behold
That chair stand empty: but we all are men,
In our own natures frail, and capable
Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty
And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,
Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling
The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,
For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,
Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,
And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.

 This is too much;
Forbear, for shame, my lords.

 Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,
I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;
There to remain till the king's further pleasure
Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?

 'Tis now too certain:
How much more is his life in value with him?
Would I were fairly out on't!

 Thus far,
My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace
To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed
Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,
If there be faith in men, meant for his trial,
And fair purgation to the world, than malice,
I'm sure, in me.

"
471,gar.,GARDINER,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-gar.," But to be commanded
For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.

 It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?

 These should be hours for necessities,
Not for delights; times to repair our nature
With comforting repose, and not for us
To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!
Whither so late?

 I did, Sir Thomas; and left him at primero
With the Duke of Suffolk.

 Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?
It seems you are in haste: an if there be
No great offence belongs to't, give your friend
Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk,
As they say spirits do, at midnight, have
In them a wilder nature than the business
That seeks dispatch by day.

 The fruit she goes with
I pray for heartily, that it may find
Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,
I wish it grubb'd up now.

 But, sir, sir,
Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman
Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;
And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,
'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me,
Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,
Sleep in their graves.

 Yes, yes, Sir Thomas
There are that dare; and I myself have ventured
To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,
Sir, I may tell it you, I think I have
Incensed the lords o' the council, that he is,
For so I know he is, they know he is,
A most arch heretic, a pestilence
That does infect the land: with which they moved
Have broken with the king; who hath so far
Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace
And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded
To-morrow morning to the council-board
He be convented.   He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,
And we must root him out. From your affairs
I hinder you too long: good night, Sir Thomas.

 Has he had knowledge of it?

 Yes.

 Which reformation must be sudden too,
My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses
Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,
But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,
Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,
Out of our easiness and childish pity
To one man's honour, his contagious sickness,
Farewell all physic: and what follows then?
Commotions, uproars, with a general taint
Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,
The upper Germany, can dearly witness,
Yet freshly pitied in our memories.

 My lord, because we have business of more moment,
We will be short with you.   'Tis his highness' pleasure,
And our consent, for better trial of you,
From hence you be committed to the Tower;
Where, being but a private man again,
You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,
More than, I fear, you are provided for.

 My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,
That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,
To men that understand you, words and weakness.

 Good master secretary,
I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst
Of all this table, say so.

 Do not I know you for a favourer
Of this new sect? ye are not sound.

 Not sound, I say.

 I shall remember this bold language.

 I have done.

 What other
Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.
Let some o' the guard be ready there.
Enter Guard.
 Receive him,
And see him safe i' the Tower.

 Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven
In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;
Not only good and wise, but most religious:
One that, in all obedience, makes the church
The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen
That holy duty, out of dear respect,
His royal self in judgement comes to hear
The cause betwixt her and this great offender.

 With a true heart
And brother-love I do it.

"
472,lin.,Bishop of Lincoln,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-lin.," Very well, my liege.

 So please your highness,
The question did at first so stagger me,
Bearing a state of mighty moment in't
And consequence of dread, that I committed
The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;
And did entreat your highness to this course
Which you are running here.

"
473,aber.,LORD ABERGAVENNY,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-aber.," I cannot tell
What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye
Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,
Or has given all before, and he begins
A new hell in himself.

 I do know
Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
By this so sicken'd their estates, that never
They shall abound as formerly.

 Is it therefore
The ambassador is silenced?

 A proper title of a peace; and purchased
At a superfluous rate!

 As the duke said,
The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure
By me obey'd!

"
474,sands.,LORD SANDS,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-sands.," New customs,
Though they be never so ridiculous,
Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.

 They have all new legs, and lame ones: one would take it,
That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin
Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.

 'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases
Are grown so catching.

 The devil fiddle 'em!   I am glad they are going,
For sure, there's no converting of 'em: now
An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong
And have an hour of hearing; and, by 'r lady,
Held current music too.

 No, my lord;
Nor shall not, while I have a stump.

 He may, my lord; has wherewithal: in him
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:
Men of his way should be most liberal;
They are set here for examples.

 I am your lordship's.
Exeunt. Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinal
But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these
Should find a running banquet ere they rested,
I think would better please 'em: by my life,
They are a sweet society of fair ones.

 I would I were;
They should find easy penance.

 As easy as a down-bed would afford it.

 By my faith,
And thank your lordship.   By your leave, sweet ladies:
If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;
I had it from my father.

 O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:
But he would bite none; just as I do now,
He would kiss you twenty with a breath.

Kisses her.
 For my little cure,
Let me alone.
Hautboys. Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, and
                 takes his state.
 Your grace is noble:
Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
And save me so much talking.

 The red wine first must rise
In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em
Talk us to silence.

 Yes, if I make my play.
Here 's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,
For 'tis to such a thing,--

 I told your grace they would talk anon.

Drum and trumpet, chambers discharged.
"
475,guild.,SIR HENRY GUILDFORD,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-guild.," Ladies, a general welcome from his grace
Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates
To fair content and you: none here, he hopes,
In all this noble bevy, has brought with her
One care abroad; he would have all as merry
As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,
Can make good people. O, my lord, you're tardy:
Enter LORD CHAMBERLAIN, LORD SANDS,
           and SIR THOMAS LOVELL.
The very thought of this fair company
Clapp'd wings to me.

"
476,lov.,SIR THOMAS LOVELL,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-lov.," Faith, my lord,
I hear of none, but the new proclamation
That's clapp'd upon the court-gate.

 The reformation of our travell'd gallants,
That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.

 They must either,
For so run the conditions, leave those remnants
Of fool and feather that they got in France,
With all their honourable points of ignorance
Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,
Abusing better men than they can be,
Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean
The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,
Short blister'd breeches, and those types of travel,
And understand again like honest men;
Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,
They may, 'cum privilegio,' wear away
The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.

 Ay, marry,
There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.

 To the cardinal's:
Your lordship is a guest too.

 That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
His dews fall every where.

 O, that your lordship were but now confessor
To one or two of these!

 Faith, how easy?

 Yes, my lord.

 I do beseech your grace, for charity,
If ever any malice in your heart
Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.

 To the water side I must conduct your grace;
Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,
Who undertakes you to your end.

 Came you from the king, my lord?

 I must to him too,
Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.

 My lord, I love you;
And durst commend a secret to your ear
Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,
They say, in great extremity; and fear'd
She'll with the labour end.

 Methinks I could
Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
Deserve our better wishes.

 Now, sir, you speak of two
The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,
Beside that of the jewel house, is made master
O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,
Stands in lte gap and trade of moe preferments,
With which the time will load him.   The archbishop
Is the king's hand and tongue'; and who dare speak
One syllable against him?

 Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.
Exeunt Gardiner and Page. 
Enter the KING and SUFFOLK. 
 I could not personally deliver to her
What you commanded me, but by her woman
I sent your message; who return'd her thanks
In the greatest humbleness, and desired your highness
Most heartily to pray for her.

 So said her woman; and that her sufferance made
Almost each pang a death.

 This is about that which the bishop spake:
I am happily come hither.
Re-enter DENNY, with CRANMER.
 Sir?

"
477,den.,SIR ANTHONY DENNY,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-den.," Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,
As you commanded me.

 Ay, my good lord.

 He attends your highness' pleasure.

"
478,vaux.,SIR NICHOLAS VAUX,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-vaux.," Prepare there,
The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;
And fit it with such furniture as suits
The greatness of his person.

"
479,first-secr.,First Secretary,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-first-secr.," Here, so please you.

 Ay, please your grace.

"
480,crom.,CROMWELL,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-crom.," To his own hand, in's bedchamber.

 Presently
He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,
He did it with a serious mind; a heed
Was in his countenance. You he bade
Attend him here this morning.

 I think, by this he is.

 I have no power to speak, sir.

 How does your grace?

 I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.

 The heaviest and the worst
Is your displeasure with the king.

 The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Lord chancellor in your place.

 That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.

 Last, that the Lady Anne,
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,
This day was view'd in open as his queen,
Going to chapel; and the voice is now
Only about her coronation.

 O my lord,
Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forgo
So good, so noble and so true a master?
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
The king shall have my service; but my prayers
For ever and for ever shall be yours.

 Good sir, have patience.

 Please your honours,
The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.

 Yes.

 My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,
By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,
However faulty, yet should find respect
For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty
To load a falling man.

 Why, my lord?

 Not sound?

 Would you were half so honest!
Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.

 Do.
Remember your bold life too.

 And I.

 My mind gave me,
In seeking tales and informations
Against this man, whose honesty the devil
And his disciples only envy at,
Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!
Enter KING, frowning on them; takes his
                       seat.
"
481,grif.,GRIFFITH,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-grif.," Madam, you are call'd back.

 How does your grace?

 Yes, madam; but I think your grace,
Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to 't.

 Well, the voice goes, madam:
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill
He could not sit his mule.

 At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend
With all his covent, honourably received him;
To whom he gave these words, 'O father abbot,
An old man, broken with the storms of state,
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;
Give him a little earth for charity!'
So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness
Pursued him still; and, three nights after this,
About the hour of eight, which he himself
Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
He gave his honours to the world again,
His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.

 Noble madam,
Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues
We write in water. May it please your highness
To hear me speak his good now?

 This cardinal,
Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly
Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken and persuading:
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.
And though he were unsatisfied in getting,
Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,
He was most princely: ever witness for him
Those twins of learning that he raised in you,
Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,
So excellent in art, and still so rising,
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;
For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
And found the blessedness of being little:
And, to add greater honours to his age
Than man could give him, he died fearing God.

 She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,
For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.
The vision.  Enter, solemnly tripping one after another, six personages, clad in white robes, wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in their hands. They first congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold a spare garland over her head; at which the other four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held the garland deliver the same to the other next two, who observe the same order in their changes, and holding the garland over her head: which done, they deliver the same garland to the last two, who likewise observe the same order: at which, as it were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven: and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The music continues.
 Madam, we are here.

 None, madam.

 I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
Possess your fancy.

 She is going, wench: pray, pray.

 You are to blame,
Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,
To use so rude behaviour; go to, kneel.

"
482,first-gent.,First Gentleman,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-first-gent.," Whither away so fast?

 I'll save you
That labour, sir.   All's now done, but the ceremony
Of bringing back the prisoner.

 Yes, indeed, was I.

 You may guess quickly what.

 Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon 't.

 So are a number more.

 I'll tell you in a little.   The great duke
Came to the bar; where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
The king's attorney on the contrary
Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions
Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired
To have brought viva voce to his face:
At which appear'd against him his surveyor;
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,
Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,
Hopkins that made this mischief.

 The same.
All these accused him strongly; which he fain
Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:
And so his peers, upon this evidence,
Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.

 When he was brought again to the bar, to hear
His knell rung out, his judgement, he was stirr'd
With such an agony, he sweat extremely,
And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:
But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.

 Sure, he does not--
He never was so womanish; the cause
He may a little grieve at.

 'Tis likely,
By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,
Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,
Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,
Lest he should help his father.

 At his return
No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,
And generally, whoever the king favours,
The cardinal instantly will find employment,
And far enough from court too.

 Stay there, sir,
And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.
Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment;
   tipstaves before him; the axe with the edge
   towards him; halberds on each side: ac-
   companied with SIR THOMAS LOVELL, SIR
   NICHOLAS VAUX, SIR WILLIAM SANDS,
   and common people.
 O, this is full of pity!   Sir, it calls,
I fear, too many curses on their heads
That were the authors.

 Good angels keep it from us!
What may it be?   You do not doubt my faith, sir?

 Let me have it;
I do not talk much.

 Yes, but it held not:
For when the king once heard it, out of anger
He sent command to the lord mayor straight
To stop the rumour, and allay those tongues
That durst disperse it.

 'Tis the cardinal;
And merely to revenge him on the emperor
For not bestowing on him, at his asking,
The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.

 'Tis woful.
We are too open here to argue this;
Let's think in private more.
Exeunt.
 You're well met once again.

 You come to take your stand here, and behold
The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?

 'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;
This, general joy.

 Never greater,
Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.

 Yes; 'tis the list
Of those that claim their offices this day
By custom of the coronation.
The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,
He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.

 That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
Of Canterbury, accompanied with other
Learned and reverend fathers of his order,
Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off
From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which
She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:
And, to be short, for not appearance and
The king's late scruple, by the main assent
Of all these learned men she was divorced,
And the late marriage made of none effect:
Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,
Where she remains now sick.

 Marquess Dorset:
And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.

 'Tis the same: high-steward.

 Yes.

 They that bear
The cloth of honour over her, are four barons
Of the Cinque-ports.

 It is; and all the rest are countesses.

 No more of that.

[Exit procession, and then a great flourish
                         of trumpets.
Enter a third Gentleman.
 God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?

 How was it?

 Sir,
You must no more call it York-place, that's past;
For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:
'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.

"
483,sec.-gent.,Second Gentleman,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-sec.-gent.," O, God save ye!
Even to the hall, to hear what shall become
Of the great Duke of Buckingham.

 Were you there?

 Pray, speak what has happen'd.

 Is he found guilty?

 I am sorry for't.

 But, pray, how pass'd it?

 That was he
That fed him with his prophecies?

 After all this, how did he bear himself?

 I do not think he fears death.

 Certainly
The cardinal is the end of this.

 That trick of state
Was a deep envious one.

 All the commons
Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,
Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much
They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,
The mirror of all courtesy;--

 Let's stand close, and behold him.

 If the duke be guiltless,
'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling
Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
Greater than this.

 This secret is so weighty, 'twill require
A strong faith to conceal it.

 I am confident;
You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear
A buzzing of a separation
Between the king and Katharine?

 But that slander, sir,
Is found a truth now: for it grows again
Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain
The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,
Or some about him near, have, out of malice
To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple
That will undo her: to confirm this too,
Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;
As all think, for this business.

 I think you have hit the mark: but is 't not cruel
That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal
Will have his will, and she must fall.

 So are you.

 'Tis all my business.   At our last encounter,
The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.

 'Tis well: the citizens,
I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--
As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--
In celebration of this day with shows,
Pageants and sights of honour.

 May I be bold to ask what that contains,
That paper in your hand?

 I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,
I should have been beholding to your paper.
But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,
The princess dowager? how   goes her business?

 Alas, good lady!

Trumpets.
The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.
Hautboys.
THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION.
1.  A lively flourish of Trumpets
2.  Then, two Judges.
3.  Lord Chancellor, with the purse and mace before him.
4.  Choristers, singing.  [Music.
5.  Mayor of London, bearing the mace.  Then
Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his
head a gilt copper crown.
6.  Marquess DORSET, bearing a sceptre of
gold, on his head a demi-coronal of
 gold. With him, the Earl of SURREY,
bearing the rod of silver, with the dove,
 crowned with an earl's coronet. Collars
of SS.
7.  Duke of SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate,
his coronet on his head, bearing a long
 white wand, as high-steward.   With
him, the Duke of NORFOLK, with the
 rod of marshalship, a coronet on his
 head. Collars of SS.
8.  A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-
ports; under it, the Queen in her robe;
in her hair richly adorned with pearl,
crowned.   On each side her, the
Bishops of London and Winchester.
9.  The old Duchess of NORFOLK, in a coronal
of gold, wrought with flowers, bearing
the Queen's train.
10.  Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain
circlets of gold without flowers.

They pass over the stage in order and state.

 A royal train, believe me. These I know:
Who's that that bears the sceptre?

 A bold brave gentleman. That should be
The Duke of Suffolk?

 And that my Lord of Norfolk?

 Heaven bless thee!

[Looking on the Queen.
Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;
Our king has all the Indies in his arms,
And more and richer, when he strains that lady:
I cannot blame his conscience.

 Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.
I take it, she that carries up the train
Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.

 Their coronets say so.   These are stars indeed;
And sometimes falling ones.

 You saw
The ceremony?

 Good sir, speak it to us.

 But, what follow'd?

 What two reverend bishops
Were those that went on each side of the queen?

 He of Winchester
Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,
The virtuous Cranmer.

 Who may that be, I pray you?

 He will deserve more.

"
484,third-gent.,Third Gentleman,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-third-gent.," Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger
Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled
With the mere rankness of their joy.

 That I did.

 Well worth seeing.

 As well as I am able. The rich stream
Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen
To a prepared place in the choir, fell off
A distance from her; while her grace sat down
To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,
In a rich chair of state, opposing freely
The beauty of her person to the people.
Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman
That ever lay by man: which when the people
Had the full view, such a noise arose
As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,
As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks,--
Doublets, I think,--flew   up; and had their faces
Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy
I never saw before. Great-bellied women,
That had not half a week to go, like rams
In the old time of war, would shake the press,
And make 'em reel before 'em.   No man living
Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven
So strangely in one piece.

 At length her grace rose, and with modest paces
Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like
Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.
Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:
When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
She had all the royal makings of a queen;
As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,
The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems
Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,
With all the choicest music of the kingdom,
Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,
And with the same full state paced back again
To York-place, where the feast is held.

 I know it;
But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name
Is fresh about me.

 Stokesly and Cardiner; the one of Winchester,
Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,
The other, London.

 All the land knows that:
However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,
Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.

 Thomas Cromwell;
A man in much esteem with the king, and truly
A worthy friend. The king hath made him master
O' the jewel house,
And one, already, of the privy council.

 Yes, without all doubt.
Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which
Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:
Something I can command. As I walk thither,
I'll tell ye more.

"
485,butts.,DOCTOR BUTTS,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-butts.," This is a piece of malice. I am glad
I came this way so happily: the king
Shall understand it presently.
[Exit.
 I'll show your grace the strangest sight--

 I think your highness saw this many a day.

 There, my lord:
The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;
Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,
Pages, and footboys.

"
486,gart.,Garter King-at-Arms,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-gart., 
487,surv.,Surveyor to the Duke of Buckingham,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-surv.," First, it was usual with him, every day
It would infect his speech, that if the king
Should without issue die, he'll carry it so
To make the sceptre his: these very words
I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,
Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced
Revenge upon the cardinal.

 He was brought to this
By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.

 Sir, a Chartreux friar,
His confessor; who fed him every minute
With words of sovereignty.

 Not long before your highness sped to France,
The duke being at the Rose, within the parish
Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
What was the speech among the Londoners
Concerning the French journey: I replied,
Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,
To the king's danger. Presently the duke
Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,
'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
To hear from him a matter of some moment:
Whom after under the confession's seal
He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
My chaplain to no creature living, but
To me, should utter, with demure confidence
This pausingly ensued: Neither the king nor's heirs,
Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive
To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke
Shall govern England.'

 On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions
The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him
To ruminate on this so far, until
It forged him some design, which, being believed,
It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,
It can do me no damage;' adding further,
That had the king in his last sickness fail'd,
The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
Should have gone off.

 I can, my liege.

 Being at Greenwich,
After your highness had reproved the duke
About Sir William Blomer,--

 'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,
As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd
The part my father meant to act upon
The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,
Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,
As he made semblance of his duty, would
Have put his knife into him.'

 After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'
He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,
Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes,
He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenour
Was,--were he evil used, he would outgo
His father by as much as a performance
Does an irresolute purpose.

To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on
The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure
You shall to the Tower.

 Nay, he must bear you company. The king
[To Abergavenny. 
Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know
How he determines further.

 Here is a warrant from
The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies
Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor,--

 A monk o' the Chartreux.

 He.

But yet I cannot help you.

 Without, my noble lords?

 My lord archbishop;
And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.

On May-day morning; which will never be:
We may as well push against Powle's, as stir 'em.

 Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?
As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--
You see the poor remainder--could distribute,
I made no spare, sir.

 I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,
To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any
That had a head to hit, either young or old,

And that I would not for a cow, God save her!

 Thank your majesty.
That you would love yourself, and in that love
Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor
The dignity of your office, is the point
Of my petition.

 I am solicited, not by a few,
And those of true condition, that your subjects
Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart
Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,
My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches
Most bitterly on you, as putter on
Of these exactions, yet the king our master--
Whose honour heaven shield from soil!-even he escapes not
Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
The sides of loyalty, and almost appears
In loud rebellion.

 No, my lord,
You know no more than others; but you frame
Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome
To those which would not know them, and yet must
Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,
Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
Most pestilent to the hearing; and, to bear em,
The back is sacrifice to the load. They say
They are devised by you; or else you suffer
Too hard an exclamation.

 I am much too venturous
In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd
Under your promised pardon.   The subjects' grief
Comes through commissions, which compel from each
The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
Without delay; and the pretence for this
Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:
Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
Allegiance in them; their curses now
Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,
This tractable obedience is a slave
To each incensed will. I would your highness
Would give it quick consideration, for
There is no primer business.

 I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
Is run in your displeasure.

 My learn'd lord cardinal,
Deliver all with charity.

 If I know you well,
You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office
On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed
You charge not in your spleen a noble person
And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;
Yes, heartily beseech you.

 God mend all!

 Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;
And to bestow your pity on me: for
I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,
Born out of your dominions; having here
No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance
Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,
In what have I offended you? what cause
Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure,
That thus you should proceed to put me off,
And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
I have been to you a true and humble wife,
At all times to your will conformable;
Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry
As I saw it inclined: when was the hour
I ever contradicted your desire,
Or made it not mine too?   Or which of your friends
Have I not strove to love, although I knew
He were mine enemy? what friend of mine
That had to him derived your anger, did I
Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice
He was from thence discharged?   Sir, call to mind
That I have been your wife, in this obedience,
Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
With many children by you: if, in the course
And process of this time, you can report,
And prove it too, against mine honour aught,
My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,
Against your sacred person, in God's name,
Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt
Shut door upon me, and so give me up
To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir,
The king, your father, was reputed for
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
And unmatch'd wit and judgement: Ferdinand,
My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one
The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
A year before: it is not to be question'd
That they had gather'd a wise council to them
Of every realm, that did debate this business,
Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly
Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may
Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel
I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,
Your pleasure be fulfill'd!

 Lord cardinal,
To you I speak.

 Sir,
I am about to weep; but, thinking that
We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain
The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
I'll turn to sparks of fire.

 I will, when you are humble; nay, before,
Or God will punish me. I do believe,
Induced by potent circumstances, that
You are mine enemy, and make my challenge
You shall not be my judge: for it is you
Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;
Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,
I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul
Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
I hold my most malicious foe, and think not
At all a friend to truth.

 My lord, my lord,
I am a simple woman, much too weak
To oppose your cunning. You're meek and humble-mouth'd;
You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,
With meekness and humility; but your heart
Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,
Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted
Where powers are your retainers, and your words,
Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,
You tender more your person's honour than
Your high profession spiritual: that again
I do refuse you for my judge; and here,
Before you all, appeal unto the pope,
To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,
And to be judged by him.

She curtsies to the King, and offers to depart.
 What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:
When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,
They vex me past my patience!   Pray you, pass on:
I will not tarry; no, nor ever more
Upon this business my appearance make
In any of ther courts.

Exeunt Queen, and her Attendants.
 Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;
Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst: leave working. How now!

 Would they speak with me?

 Pray their graces
To come near. [Exit Gent.
What can be their business
With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?
I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,
They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:
But all hoods make not monks.
Enter the two Cardinals, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS.
 Your graces find me here part of a housewife,
I would be all, against the worst may happen.
What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?

 Speak it here;
There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,
Deserves a corner: would all other women
Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
My lords, I care not, so much I am happy
Above a number, if my actions
Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,
Envy and base opinion set against 'em,
I know my life so even. If your business
Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,
Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.

 O, good my lord, no Latin;
I am not such a truant since my coming,
As not to know the language I have lived in:
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,
If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;
Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,
The willing'st sin I ever yet committed
May be absolved in English.

 To betray me.--
My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;
Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!
But how to make ye suddenly an answer,
In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--
More near my lfe, I fear,--with my weak wit,
And to such men of gravity and learning,
In truth, I know not. I was set at work
Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking
Either for such men or such business.
For her sake that I have been,--for I feel
The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,
Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!

 In England
But little for my profit: can you think, lords,
That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness pleasure,
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,
And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,
They that must weigh out my afflictions,
They that my trust must grow to, live not here:
They are, as all my other comforts, far hence
In mine own country, lords.

 How, sir?

 Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:
Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!
Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
That no king can corrupt.

 The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,
Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
But cardinal sins and nollow hearts I fear ye:
Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
I will not wish ye half my miseries;
I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;
Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once
The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.

 Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye
And all such false professors; would you have me--
If you have any justice, any pity;
If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,
His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,
And all the fellowship I hold now with him
Is only my obedience. What can happen
To me above this wretchedness? all your studies
Make me a curse like this.

 Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,
Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
Never yet branded with suspicion?
Have I with all my full affections
Still met the king? loved him next heaven? obey'd him?
Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.
Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;
And to that woman, when she has done most,
Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.

 My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,
To give up willingly that noble title
Your master wed me to: nothing but death
Shall e'er divorce my dignities.

 Would I had never trod this English earth,
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
What will become of me now, wretched lady!
I am the most unhappy woman living.
Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!
Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,
No friends, no hope; no kindred weep for me;
Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,
That once was mistress of the field and flourished,
I'll hang my head and perish.

 Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,
If I have used myself unmannerly;
You know I am a woman, lacking wit
To make a seemly answer to such persons.
Pray, do my service to his majesty:
He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers
While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,
Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,
That little thought, when she set footing here,
She should have bought her dignities so dear.

[Exeunt.
"
496,kath.,QUEEN KATHARINE,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-kath.," O Griffith, sick to death!
My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,
Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:
So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,
That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,
Was dead?

 Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:
If well, he stepp'd before me, happily
For my example.

 Alas, poor man!

 So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
And yet with charity. He was a man
Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
Himself with princes, one that, by suggestion,
Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;
His own opinion was his law: i' the presence
He would say untruths; and be ever double
Both in his words and meaning: he was never,
But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
But his performance, as he is now, nothing:
Of his own body he was ill, and gave
The clergy ill example.

 Yes, good Griffith;
I were malicious else.

 After my death I wish no other herald,
No other speaker of my living actions,
To keep mine honour from corruption,
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,
With thy religious truth and modesty,
Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!
Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:
I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,
Cause the musicians play me that sad note
I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating
On that celestial harmony I go to.

Sad and solemn music.
 Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?

 It is not you I call for:
Saw ye none enter since I slept?

 No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces
Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?
They promised me eternal happiness;
And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.

 Bid the music leave,
They are harsh and heavy to me.
Music ceases.
 You are a saucy fellow:
Deserve we no more reverence?

 Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow
Let me ne'er see again.

Exeunt Griffith and Messenger.
Re-enter GRIFFTH, with CAPUCIUS. 
If my sight fail not,
You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,
My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.

 O, my lord,
The times and titles now are alter'd strangely
With me since first you knew me.   But, I pray you,
What is your pleasure with me?

 O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;
'Tis like a pardon after execution:
That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;
But now I am past all comforts here, but prayers.
How does his highness?

 So may he ever do! and ever flourish,
When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name
Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,
I caused you write, yet sent away?

 Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver
This to my lord the king.

 In which I have commended to his goodness
The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter:
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding,--
She is young, and of a noble modest nature,
I hope she will deserve well,--and a little.
To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,
Heaven knows how dearly.   My next poor petition
Is, that his noble grace would have some pity
Upon my wretched women, that so long
Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:
Of which there is not one, I dare avow,
And now I should not lie, but will deserve,
For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
For honesty and decent carriage,
A right good husband, let him be a noble:
And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.
The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,
But poverty could never draw 'em from me;
That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,
And something over to remember me by:
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
And able means, we had not parted thus.
These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,
By that you love the dearest in this world,
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,
Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king
To do me this last right.

 I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
In all humility unto his highness:
Say his long trouble now is passing
Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,
You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;
Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,
Let me be used with honour: strew me over
With maiden flowers, that all the world may know
I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,
Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
I can no more.
Exeunt, leading Katharine.
"
497,anne.,ANNE BULLEN,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-anne.," Was he mad, sir?

 You are a merry gamester,
My Lord Sands.

 You cannot show me.

 Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:
His highness having lived so long with her, and she
So good a lady that no tongue could ever
Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,
She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after
So many courses of the sun enthroned,
Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,
To give her the avaunt! it is a pity
Would move a monster.

 O, God's will! much better
She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,
Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging
As soul and body's severing.

 So much the more
Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,
And range with humble livers in content,
Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,
And wear a golden sorrow.

 By my troth and maidenhead,
I would not be a queen.

 Nay, good troth.

 No, not for all the riches under heaven.

 No, in truth.

 How you do talk!
I swear again, I would not be a queen
For all the world.

 My good lord,
Not your demand; it values not your asking:
Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.

 Now, I pray God, amen!

 I do not know
What kind of my obedience I should tender;
More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes
More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes
Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,
Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,
As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;
Whose health and royalty I pray for.

 My honour'd lord.

 This is strange to me.

 Come, you are pleasant.

 Good lady,
Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,
And leave me out on 't. Would I had no being,
If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,
To think what follows.
The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful
In our long absence: pray, do not deliver
What here you've heard to her.

"
498,old-l.,An old Lady,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-old-l.," Hearts of most hard temper
Melt and lament for her.

 Alas: poor lady!
She's a stranger now again.

 Our content
Is our best having.

 Beshrew me, I would,
And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,
For all this spice of your hypocrisy:
You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,
Have too a woman's heart: which ever yet
Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;
Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,
Saving your mincing, the capacity
Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,
If you might please to stretch it.

 Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?

 'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,
Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,
What think you of a duchess? have you limbs
To bear that load of title?

 Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;
I would not be a young count in your way,
For more than blushing comes to: if your back
Cannot vouchsafe this burthen, 'tis too weak
Ever to get a boy.

 In faith, for little England
You'ld venture an emballing: I myself
Would   for Carnarvonshire, although there 'long'd
No more to the crown but that.   Lo, who comes here?
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN. 
 Why, this it is; see, see!
I have been begging sixteen years in court,
And yet a courtier beggarly, nor could
Come pat betwixt too early and too late
For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!
A very fresh fish here--fie, fie, fie upon
This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up
Before you open it.

 How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no.
There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,
That would not be a queen, that would she not,
For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?

 With your theme, I could
O'ermount the lark.   The Marchioness of Pembroke!
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!
No other obligation! By my life,
That promises moe thousands: honour's train
Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time
I know your back will bear a duchess: say,
Are you not stronger than you were?

 What do you think me?

[Exeunt.
 I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring
Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels
Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person
Under their blessed wings!

 Ay, ay, my liege;
And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven
Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,
Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
Desires your visitation, and to be
Acquainted with this stranger: 'tis as like you
As cherry is to cherry.

 An hundred marks by this light, I'll ha' more.
An ordinary groom is for such payment.
I will have more, or scold it out of him.
Said I for this, the girl was like to him?
I will have more, or else unsay 't; and now,
While it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.

 Send for him, good uncle.

 Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
Before we hear him, of some things of weight
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and
             the BISHOP OF ELY.

 Sure, we thank you.
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salique that they have in France
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
With opening titles miscreate, whose right
Suits not in native colors with the truth;
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
For never two such kingdoms did contend
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
That make such waste in brief mortality.
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
For we will hear, note and believe in heart
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
As pure as sin with baptism.

 May I with right and conscience make this claim?

 We must not only arm to invade the French,
But lay down our proportions to defend
Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
With all advantages.

 We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us;
For you shall read that my great-grandfather
Never went with his forces into France
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
With ample and brim fulness of his force,
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
That England, being empty of defence,
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighborhood.

 Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
Exeunt some Attendants. 
Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,
Ruling in large and ample empery
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
Tombless, with no remembrance over them:
Either our history shall with full mouth
Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.
Enter Ambassadors of France.
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
Your greeting is from him, not from the king.

 We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
Tell us the Dauphin's mind.

 What treasure, uncle?

 We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
His present and your pains we thank you for:
When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,
We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
With chaces. And we understand him well,
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
Not measuring what use we made of them.
We never valued this poor seat of England;
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
To barbarous license; as 'tis ever common
That men are merriest when they are from home.
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
For that I have laid by my majesty
And plodded like a man for working-days,
But I will rise there with so full a glory
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God,
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
To venge me as I may and to put forth
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
His jest will savor but of shallow wit,
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
Convey them with safe conduct.   Fare you well.
[Exeunt Ambassadors. 
 We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
That may give furtherance to our expedition;
For we have now no thought in us but France,
Save those to God, that run before our business.
Therefore let our proportions for these wars
Be soon collected and all things thought upon
That may with reasonable swiftness add
More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
Therefore let every man now task his thought,
That this fair action may on foot be brought.
                            Exeunt.
Flourish.
 Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:
Think you not that the powers we bear with us
Will cut their passage through the force of France,
Doing the execution and the act
For which we have in head assembled them?

 I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded
We carry not a heart with us from hence
That grows not in a fair consent with ours,
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
Success and conquest to attend on us.

 We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
And shall forget the office of our hand,
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
According to the weight and worthiness.

 We judge no less.   Uncle of Exeter,
Enlarge the man committed yesterday,
That rail'd against our person: we consider
It was excess of wine that set him on;
And on his more advice we pardon him.

 O, let us yet be merciful.

 Alas, your too much love and care of me
Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,
Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,
Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care
And tender preservation of our person,
Would have him punish'd. And now to our French causes:
Who are the late commissioners?

 Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,
Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.
My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,
We will aboard to night.   Why, how now, gentlemen!
What see you in those papers that you lose
So much complexion?   Look ye, how they change!
Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there,
That hath so cowarded and chased your blood
Out of appearance?

 The mercy that was quick in us but late,
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
See you, my princes and my noble peers,
These English monsters!   My Lord of Cambridge here,
You know how apt our love was to accord
To furnish him with all appertinents
Belonging to his honor; and this man
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,
And sworn unto the practices of France,
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use!
May it be possible, that foreign hire
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
Treason and murder ever kept together,
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
Working so grossly in a natural cause,
That admiration did not whoop at them:
But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
That wrought upon thee so preposterously
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:
All other devils that suggest by treasons
Do botch and bungle up damnation
With patches, colors, and with forms being fetch'd
From glistering semblance of piety;
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
He might return to vasty Tartar back,
And tell the legions 'I can never win
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
O, how hast thou with jealousy infected
The sweetness of affiance!   Show men dutiful?
Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?
Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?
Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
Not working with the eye without the ear,
And but in purged judgement trusting neither?
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
Arrest them to the answer of the law;
And God acquit them of their practices!

 God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
You have conspired against our royal person,
Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
Received the golden earnest of our death;
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
His princes and his peers to servitude,
His subjects to oppression and contempt
And his whole kingdom into desolation.
Touching our person seek we no revenge;
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
The taste whereof, God of his mercy give
You patience to endure, and true repentance
Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.

[Exeunt Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, guarded
Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
Since God so graciously hath brought to light
This dangerous treason lurking in our way
To hinder our beginnings.   We doubt not now
But every rub is smoothed on our way.
Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
Our puissance into the hand of God,
Putting it straight in expedition.
Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
No king of England, if not king of France.
[Exeunt.
 Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favor'd rage;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let it pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English,
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
Dishonor not your mothers; now attest
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base,
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'
[Exeunt.   Alarum, and chambers go off.
 How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parley we will admit:
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;
Or like to men proud of destructon
Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
If I begin the battery once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
Till in her ashes she lie buried.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
In liberty of bloody hand shall range
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.
What is it then to me, if impious war,
Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,
Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing violation?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
As send precepts to the leviathan
To come ashore.   Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
Take pity of your town and of your people,
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
Of heady murder, spoil and villany.
If not, why, in a moment look to see
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
What say you? will you yield, and thus avoid,
Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?

 Open your gates.   Come, uncle Exeter,
Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:
Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,
The winter coming on and sickness growing
Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
To-night in Harfleur will we be your guest;
To-morrow for the march are we addrest.

[Flourish.   The King and his train enter the town. How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?

 What men have you lost, Fluellen?

    What is thy name?   I know thy quality.

 Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back,
And tell thy king I do not seek him now;
But could be willing to march on to Calais
Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,
Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
My numbers lessen'd, and those few I have
Almost no better than so many French;
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
I thought upon one pair of English legs
Did march three Frenchmen.   Yet, forgive me, God,
That I do brag thus! This your air of France
Hath blown that vice in me; I must repent.
Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
My army but a weak and sickly guard;
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
Though France himself and such another neighbour
Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.
Go, bid thy master well advise himself:
If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
Discolour: and so, Montjoy, fare you well.
The sum of a!l our answer is but this:
We would not seek a battle, as we are;
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:
So tell your master.

 We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
And on to-morrow bid them march away.
[Exeunt.
 Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;
The greater therefore should our courage be.
Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!
There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
Would men observingly distil it out.
For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers,
Which is both healthful and good husbandry:
Besides, they are our outward consciences,
And preachers to us all, admonishing
That we should dress us fairly for our end.
Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
And make a moral of the devil himself.
Enter ERPINGHAM.
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:
A good soft pillow for that good white head
Were better than a churlish turf of France.

 'Tis good for men to love their present pains
Upon example; so the spirit is eased:
And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,
The organs, though defunct and dead before,
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move;
With casted slough and fresh legerity.
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.   Brothers both,
Commend me to the princes in our camp;
Do my good morrow to them, and anon
Desire them all to my pavilion.

 No, my good knight;
Go with my brothers to my lords of England:
I and my bosom must debate a while,
And then I would no other company.

 God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.
Enter PISTOL.
            Though it appear a little out of fashion,
There is much care and valor in this Welshman.
Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT, and MICHAEL WILLIAMS.
                Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,
Our debts, our careful wives,
Our children and our sins lay on the king!
We must bear all. O hard condition,
Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel
But his own wringing!   What infinite heart'sease
Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!
And what have kings, that privates have not too,
Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?
What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?
O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
What is thy soul of adoration?
Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,
Creating awe and fear in other men?
Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
Than they in fearing.
What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
But poison'd flattery?  O, be sick, great greatness,
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
With titles blown from adulation?
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,
Command the health of it?   No, thou proud dream,
That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;
I am a king that find thee, and I know
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
The farced title running 'fore the king,
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
That beats upon the high shore of this world,
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
But, like a lackey, from the rise to set
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,
And follows so the ever-running year,
With profitable labor, to his grave:
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.
The slave, a member of the country's peace,
Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.
Re-enter ERPINGHAM.
 Good old knight,
Collect them all together at my tent:
I'll be before thee.

 O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
Possess them not with fear; take from them now
The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers
Pluck their hearts from them.   Not to-day, O Lord,
O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
My father made in compassing the crown!
I Richard's body have interred anew;
And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears
Than from it issued forced drops of blood:
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,
Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up
Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built
Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;
Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
Since that my penitence comes after all,
Imploring pardon.
Re-enter GLOUCESTER.
 My brother Gloucester's voice? Ay;
I know thy errand, I will go with thee:
The day, my friends and all things stay for me.
[Exeunt. 
 What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland?   No, my fair cousin:
If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
To do our country loss; and if to live,
The fewer men, the greater share of honor.
God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
But if it be a sin to covet honor,
I am the most offending soul alive.
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honor
As one man more, methinks, would share from me
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart; his passport shall be made
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
We would not die in that man's company
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is call'd the feast of Crispian:
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
He that shall live this day, and see old age,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors,
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
But he'll remember with advantages
What feats he did that day: then shall our names,
Familiar in his mouth as household words,
Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
From this day to the ending of the world,
But we in it shall be remembered;
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
Re-enter SALISBURY.
 All things are ready, if our minds be so.

 Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?

 Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;
Which likes me better than to wish us one.
You know your places: God be with you all!
Tucket. Enter MONTJOY.
 Who hath sent thee now?

 I pray thee, bear my former answer back:
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
The man that once did sell the lion's skin.
While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,
And draw their honors reeking up to heaven;
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
Mark then abounding valor in our English,
That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,
Break out into a second course of mischief,
Killing in relapse of mortality.
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable
We are but warriors for the working-day;
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
With rainy marching in the painful field;
There's not a piece of feather in our host--
Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
And time hath worn us into slovenry:
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;
And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads
And turn them out of service.   If they do this,--
As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then
Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labor;
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,
Shall yield them little, tell the constable.

 I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.
Enter YORK.
 Take it, brave York.   Now, soldiers, march away:
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!

[Exeunt.
 Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:
But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.

 Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour
I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;
From helmet to the spur all blood he was.

 I blame you not;
For, hearing this, I must perforce compound
With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.

[Alarum.
But, hark! what new alarum is this same?
The French have reinforced their scatter'd men:
Then every soldier kill his prisoners:
Give the word through.
[Exeunt.
 I was not angry since I came to France
Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
If they will fight with us, bid them come down,
Or void the field; they do offend our sight:
If they'll do neither, we will come to them,
And make them skirr away, as swift as stones
Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,
And not a man of them that we shall take
Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
Enter MONTJOY.
 How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not
That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
Comest thou again for ransom?

 I tell thee truly, herald,
I know not if the day be ours or no;
For yet a many of your horsemen peer
And gallop o'er the field.

 Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?

 Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.

  I wear it for a memorable honor;
For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.

  God keep me so!  Our heralds go with him:
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead
On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.

[Points to Williams. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy.
  An Englishman?

         My lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,
Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:
The glove which I have given him for a favor
May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;
It is the soldier's; I by bargain should
Wear it myself.   Follow, good cousin Warwick:
If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
Some sudden mischief may arise of it;
For I do know Fluellen valiant
And, touch'd with choler, hot as gunpowder,
And quickly will return an injury:
Follow, and see there be no harm between them.
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.
[Exeunt.
     Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,
And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;
And wear it for an honor in thy cap
Till I do challenge it. Give him the crowns:
And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.

   This note doth tell me of ten thousand French
That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
One hundred twenty six: added to these,
Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,
Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights:
So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;
The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,
And gentlemen of blood and quality.
The names of those their nobles that lie dead:
Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;
Jacques of Chatillon, admiral of France;
The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures;
Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin,
John Duke of Alencon, Anthony Duke of Brabant,
The brother to the Duke of Burgundy,
And Edward Duke of Bar: of lusty earls,
Grandpre and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix,
Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.
Here was a royal fellowship of death!
Where is the number of our English dead?

[Herald shews him another paper.
Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,
Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire:
None else of name; and of all other men
But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here;
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
Ascribe we all!   When, without stratagem,
But in plain shock and even play of battle,
Was ever known so great and little loss
On one part and on the other?   Take it, God,
For it is none but thine!

 Come, go we in procession to the village:
And be it death proclaimed through our host
To boast of this or take that praise from God
Which is his only.

 Yes, captain; but with this acknowledgement,
That God fought for us.

 Do we all holy rites;
Let there be sung 'Non nobis' and 'Te Deum;'
The dead with charity enclosed in clay:
And then to Calais; and to England then:
Where ne'er from France arrived more happy men.
[Exeunt. 
 Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!
Unto our brother France, and to our sister,
Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishes
To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;
And, as a branch and member of this royalty,
By whom this great assembly is contrived,
We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy;
And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!

 To cry amen to that, thus we appear.

 If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,
Whose want gives growth to the imperfections
Which you have cited, you must buy that peace
With full accord to all our just demands;
Whose tenours and particular effects
You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.

 Well then the peace,
Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.

 Brother, we shall.   Go, uncle Exeter,
And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,
Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;
And take with you free power to ratify,
Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best
Shall see advantageable for our dignity,
Any thing in or out of our demands,
And we'll consign thereto.   Will you, fair sister,
Go with the princes, or stay here with us?

 Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:
She is our capital demand, comprised
Within the fore-rank of our articles.

 Fair Katharine, and most fair,
Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
Such as will enter to a lady's ear
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?

 English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?

            Nay, it will please him well,
Kate; it shall please him, Kate.

 Upon that I kiss your hand, and
I call you my queen.

               I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,
Let that one article rank with the rest;
And thereupon give me your daughter.

 Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.

[Flourish.
 Prepare we for our marriage: on which day,
My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,
And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.
Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;
And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!
[Sennet. Exeunt.

By interception which they dream not of.

  Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!

Princely in both.
Enter the KING.
"
509,exe.,DUKE OF EXETER,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml-exe.," Not here in presence.

 Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
As did the former lions of your blood.

 It follows then the cat must stay at home:
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
The advised head defends itself at home;
For government, though high and low and lower,
Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
Congreeing in a full and natural close,
Like music.

 Tennis-balls, my liege.

 This was a merry message.

 They shall be apprehended by and by.

 Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favors,
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
His sovereign's life to death and treachery.
Trumpets sound.
Enter KING HENRY,
SCROOP, CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and Attendants.
  From him; and thus he greets your majesty.
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
That you divest yourself, and lay apart
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,
By law of nature and of nations, 'long
To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown
And all wide-stretched honors that pertain
By custom and the ordinance of times
Unto the crown of France. That you may know
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
He sends you this most memorable line,
In every branch truly demonstrative;
Willing you overlook this pedigree:
And when you find him evenly derived
From his most famed of famous ancestors,
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
From him the native and true challenger.

 Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries,
The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers,
That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
This is his claim, his threatening, and my message;
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
To whom expressly I bring greeting too.

 Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
And any thing that may not misbecome
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
Thus says my king; an if your father's highness
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,
That caves and womby vaultages of France
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
In second accent of his ordnance.

 He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
And, be assured, you'll find a difference,
As we his subjects have in wonder found,
Between the promise of his greener days
And these he masters now: now he weighs time
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read
In your own losses, if he stay in France.

 Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
Come here himself to question our delay;
For he is footed in this land already.

  Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it.
For thou art framed of the firm truth of valor.
[Exit Salisbury. 
 The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.

 In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,
Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds,
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,
And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes
That bloodily did yawn upon his face;
And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
As in this glorious and well-foughten field
We kept together in our chivalry!'
Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,
Commend my service to my sovereign.'
So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd
A testament of noble-ending love.
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;
But I had not so much of man in me,
And all my mother came into mine eyes
And gave me up to tears.

   Charles Duke of Orleans, nephew to the king;
John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt:
Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,
Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.

 'Tis wonderful!

 They know your grace hath cause and means and might;
So hath your highness; never king of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.

 But there's a saying very old and true,
'If that you will France win,
Then with Scotland first begin:'
For once the eagle England being in prey,
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.

 How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

  O that we now had here
But one ten thousand of those men in England
That do no work to-day!

 Perish the man whose mind is backward now!

 God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,
Without more help, could fight this royal battle!

 The king hath granted every article:
His daughter first, and then in sequel all,
According to their firm proposed natures.

513,war.,EARL OF WARWICK,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml-war., 
514,cant.,ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml-cant.," My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
But that the scambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question.

 It must be thought on.   If it pass against us,
We lose the better half of our possession:
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the church
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
As much as would maintain, to the king's honor,
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
And to the coffers of the king beside,
A thousand pounds of the year: thus runs the bill.

 'Twould drink the cup and all.

 The king is full of grace and fair regard.

 The courses of his youth promised it not.
The breath no sooner left his father's body,
But that his wildness, mortified in him,
Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
Consideration, like an angel, came
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
Leaving his body as a paradise,
To envelope and contain celestial spirits.
Never was such a sudden scholar made;
Never came reformation in a flood,
With such a heady currance, scouring faults
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
As in this king.

 Hear him but reason in divinity,
And all-admiring with an inward wish
You would desire the king were made a prelate:
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
You would say it hath been all in all his study:
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
A fearful battle render'd you in music:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
So that the art and practic part of life
Must be the mistress to this theoric:
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
And never noted in him any study,
Any retirement, any sequestration
From open haunts and popularity.

 It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected.

 He seems indifferent,
Or rather swaying more upon our part
Than cherishing the exbibiters against us;
For I have made an offer to his majesty,
Upon our spiritual convocation
And in regard of causes now in hand,
Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
As touching France, to give a greater sum
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal.

 With good acceptance of his majesty;
Save that there was not time enough to hear,
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
The severals and unhidden passages
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
And generally to the crown and seat of France
Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.

 The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?

 Then go we in, to know his embassy;
Which I could with a ready guess declare,
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

 God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it!

 Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
That owe yourselves, your lives and services
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
To make against your highness' claim to France
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany,
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
There left behind and settled certain French;
Who, holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life,
Establish'd then this law: to wit, no female
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France:
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond,
Idly supposed the founder of this law;
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
Beyond the river Sala, in the year
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
Did, as heir general, being descended
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
To find his title with some shows of truth,
Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was re-united to the crown of France.
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun,
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
To hold in right and title of the female:
So do the kings of France unto this day;
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your highness claiming from the female,
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.

 The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
When the man dies, let the inheritance
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
Stand for you own; unwind your bloody flag;
Look back into your mighty ancestors:
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
Making defeat on the full power of France,
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
Forage in blood of French nobility.
O noble English, that could entertain
With half their forces the full pride of France
And let another half stand laughing by,
All out of work and cold for action!

 O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
In aid whereof we of the spirituality
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors.

 They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.

 She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
For hear her but exampled by herself:
When all her chivalry hath been in France
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
She hath herself not only well defended
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.

 Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions,
Setting endeavour in continual motion;
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king and officers of sorts;
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold,
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
Delivering o'er to executors pale
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
That many things, having full reference
To one consent, may work contrariously:
As many arrows, loosed several ways,
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
As many lines close in the dial's centre;
So may a thousand actions, once afoot,
End in one purpose, and be all well borne
Without defeat.   Therefore to France, my liege.
Divide your happy England into four;
Whereof take you one quarter into France,
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
Let us be worried and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy.

 But what prevention?

 And a true lover of the holy church.

 We are blessed in the change.

 The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Neighbor'd by fruit of baser quality:
And so the prince obscured his contemplation
Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.

 But, my good lord,
How now for mitigation of this bill
Urged by the commons?   Doth his majesty
Incline to it, or not?

 How did this offer seem received, my lord?

 What was the impediment that broke this off?

 It is.

 I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.
Exeunt. 
 Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;

Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.

 I do confess my fault;
And do submit me to your highness' mercy.

 For me, the gold of France did not seduce;

Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

No; to the spital go,

  Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.

Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'

Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,
Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,
To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!

Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
And sword and shield,
In bloody field,

My purpose should not fail with me,
But thither would I hie.

Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,
Abate thy rage, great duke!

 Captain, I do thee beseech to do me favors:
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.

 Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,
And of buxom valor, hath, by cruel fate,
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,
That goddess blind,
That stands upon the rolling restless stone--

 Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;
For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:
A damned death!
Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free
And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:
But Exeter hath given the doom of death
For pax of little price.
Therefore, go speak; the duke will hear thy voice:
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:
Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.

  Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!

      The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
Of parents good, of fist most valiant.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string

O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,
Except, O Signieur, thou do give to me
Egregious ransom.

 Moy shall not serve; I will have forty moys;
Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat
In drops of crimson blood.

Of malady of France;
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.

And more than carefully it us concerns
To answer royally in our defences.
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and Bretagne,
Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
To line and new repair our towns of war
With men of courage and with means defendant;
For England his approaches makes as fierce
As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
It fits us then to be as provident
As fear may teach us out of late examples
Left by the fatal and neglected English
Upon our fields.

 Think we King Harry strong;
And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
That haunted us in our familiar paths:
Witness our too much memorable shame
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
And all our princes captived by the hand
Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,
Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,
Mangle the work of nature and deface
The patterns that by God and by French fathers
Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
The native mightiness and fate of him.
Enter a Messenger.
 We'll give them present audience.   Go, and bring them.
[Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords.
You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.

 From our brother England?

 Or else what follows?

 For us, we will consider of this further:
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
Back to our brother England.

 To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.

 You shall be soon dispatch'd with fair conditions:
A night is but small breath and little pause
To answer matters of this consequence.

[Flourish. Exeunt.
 'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.

 Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
Up, princes! and, with spirit of honor edged
More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:

You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,
Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;
Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,
Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg,
Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;
High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,
For your great seats now quit you of great shames.
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:
Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:
Go down upon him, you have power enough,
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
Bring him our prisoner.

 Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy,
And let him say to England that we send
To know what willing ransom he will give.
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.

 Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
Now forth, lord constable and princes all,
And quickly bring us word of England's fall.

 Right joyous are we to behold your face,
Most worthy brother England; fairly met:
So are you, princes English, every one.

O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace
To appoint some of your council presently
To sit with us once more, with better heed
To re-survey them, we will suddenly
Pass our accept and peremptory answer.

    Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,
But your request shall make me let it pass.

 Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up
Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms
Of France and England, whose very shores look pale
With envy of each other's happiness,
May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction
Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance
His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.

"
533,dau.,LEWIS,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml-dau.," My most redoubted father,
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
But that defences, musters, preparations,
Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,
As were a war in expectation.
Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
And let us do it with no show of fear;
No, with no more than if we heard that England
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
Her sceptre so fantastically borne
By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
That fear attends her not.

 Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
But though we think it so, it is no matter:
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
The enemy more mighty than he seems:
So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
Which of a weak and niggardly projection
Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
A little cloth.

 Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
Take up the English short, and let them know
Of what a monarchy you are the head:
Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
As self-neglecting.
Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and train.
 For the Dauphin,
I stand here for him: what to him from England?

 Say, if my father render fair return,
It is against my will; for I desire
Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
As matching to his youth and vanity,
I did present him with the Paris balls.

 O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,
The emptying of our fathers' luxury,
Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,
And overlook their grafters?

 By faith and honor,
Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
Our mettle is bred out and they will give
Their bodies to the lust of English youth
To new-store France with bastard warriors.

 Not so, I do beseech your majesty.

                    Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!

 Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
And give their fasting horses provender,
And after fight with them?

What rub or what impediment there is,
Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,
Dear nurse of arts, plenties and joyful births,
Should not in this best garden of the world
Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
Corrupting in it own fertility.
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,
Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,
Like prisoners wildly over-grown with hair,
Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas
The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory
Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
That should deracinate such savagery;
The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,
Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,
Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,
Losing both beauty and utility.
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,
Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,
Even so our houses and ourselves and children
Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,
The sciences that should become our country;
But grow like savages,--as soldiers will
That nothing do but meditate on blood,--
To swearing and stern looks, defused attire
And every thing that seems unnatural.
Which to reduce into our former favour

How well supplied with noble counsellors,
How modest in exception, and withal
How terrible in constant resolution,
And you shall find his vanities forespent

And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.

On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barleybroth,
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
Seem frosty?   O, for honor of our land,
Let us not hang like roping icicles
Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
Poor we may call them in their native lords,

 This becomes the great.
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
For I am sure, when he shall see our army,

And for achievement offer us his ransom.

Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins

And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,
The vapor of our valor will o'erturn them.

Who in unnecessary action swarm
About our squares of battle, were enow

Took stand for idle speculation:
But that our honors must not.   What's to say?

Thy followers of repentance; that their souls
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies
Must lie and fester.

 The Constable of France.

 I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
Thou never shalt hear herald any more.

[Exit.
 No, great king:
I come to thee for charitable license,
That we may wander o'er this bloody field
To look our dead, and then to bury them;
To sort our nobles from our common men.
For many of our princes--woe the while!--
Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds
Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,
Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
To view the field in safety and dispose
Of their dead bodies!

 The day is yours.

 They call it Agincourt.

542,first-amb.,Ambassadors to the King of England,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml-first-amb.," May't please your majesty to give us leave
Freely to render what we have in charge;
Or shall we sparingly show you far off
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?

 Thus, then, in few.
Your highness, lately sending into France,
Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
In answer of which claim, the prince our master
Says that you savor too much of your youth,
And bids you be advised there's nought in France
That can be with a nimble galliard won;
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
Hear no more of you.   This the Dauphin speaks.

"
543,q.-isa.,ISABEL,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml-q.-isa.," So happy be the issue, brother England,
Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,
As we are now glad to behold your eyes;
Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them
Against the French, that met them in their bent,
The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,
Have lost their quality, and that this day
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.

 You English princes all, I do salute you.

 Our gracious brother, I will go with them:
Haply a woman's voice may do some good,
When articles too nicely urged be stood on.

 She hath good leave.

Exeunt all except Henry, Katharine, and Alice.
 God, the best maker of all marriages,
Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!
As man and wife, being two, are one in love,
So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,
That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,
To make divorce of their incorporate league;
That English may as French, French Englishmen,
Receive each other. God speak this Amen!

Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.

 Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
But sup them well and look unto them all:
To-morrow I intend to hunt again.

 What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?

 O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings out upon his fingers,
A most delicious banquet by his bed.
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
Would not the beggar then forget himself?

 Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him up and manage well the jest:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
Procure me music ready when he wakes,
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
And with a low submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers;
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say 'Will't please you lordship cool your hands?'
Some one be ready with a costly suit
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his lady mourns at his disease:
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
It will be pastime passing excellent,
If it be husbanded with modesty.

 Take him up gently and to bed with him;
And each one to his office when he wakes.

Some bear out Sly. A trumpet sounds.
Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
Exit Servingman.
Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
Re-enter Servingman.
How now! who is it?

 Bid them come near.
Enter Players.
Now, fellows, you are welcome.

 Do you intend to stay with me tonight?

 With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.

 'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
Well, you are come to me in happy time;
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behaviour,--
For yet his honour never heard a play--
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
If you should smile he grows impatient.

 Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
And give them friendly welcome every one:
Let them want nothing that my house affords.
Exit one with the Players.
Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
He bear himself with honorable action,
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
May show her duty and make known her love?'
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his bosom,
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
To see her noble lord restored to health,
Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears,
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Which in a napkin being close convey'd
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
Exit a Servingman.
I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
Exeunt.
 Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
O, that a mighty man of such descent,
Of such possessions and so high esteem,
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!

 Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
Each in his office ready at thy beck.
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
Music.
And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou sleep?   we'll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark: or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.

 We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
And how she was beguiled and surprised,
As lively painted as the deed was done.

 Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord:
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age.

  'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords call ladies.

I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:

And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.

My men should call me 'lord:' I am your good-man.

 I know it well. What must I call her?

And slept above some fifteen year or more.

 Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.

 Thrice-noble lord, let me entreat of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two,
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
For your physicians have expressly charged,
In peril to incur your former malady,

I hope this reason stands for my excuse.

 No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.

 And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
She was the fairest creature in the world;
And yet she is inferior to none.

 O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
And rail upon the hostess of the house;
And say you would present her at the leet,
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

 Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,

607,bap.,BAPTISTA,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-bap.," Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolved you know:
That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder:
If either of you both love Katharina,
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
 Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
What I have said, Bianca, get you in
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

 Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
Go in, Bianca:
Exit Bianca.
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music, instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
I will be very kind, and liberal
To mine own children in good bringing up:
And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
For I have more to commune with Bianca.
Exit.
 Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

 What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
Exit Bianca. 
 Was ever gentleman thus grieved asI?
 But who comes here?
 Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a
mean man; PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO
as a musician; and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books.
  I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.

 You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
But for my daughter, Katharine, this I know,
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.

 Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

 I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.

  Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?

 A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir.
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
                Enter a Servant.
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
To my daughters; and tell them both,
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
Exit Servant, with Lucentio and Hortensio,Biondello following
We will go walk a little in the orchard,
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.

 After my death the one half of my lands,
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.

 Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
That is, her love; for that is all in all.

 Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

 How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?

 What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

 Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

 Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

 Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

 Why, how now, daughter Katharine! in your dumps?

 I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.

 Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
And venture madly on a desperate mart.

 The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

 Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?

 I must confess your offer is the best;
And, let your father make her the assurance,
She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
If you should die before him, where's her dower?

 Well, gentlemen,
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
My daughter Katharine is to be married:
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
If not, to Signior Gremio:
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.

 Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day
That Katharine and Petruchio should be married,
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
What will be said? what mockery will it be,
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?

 Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
For such an injury would vex a very saint,
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
               Enter BIONDELLO.
  Is he come?

 What then?

 When will he be here?

  I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

 Didst thou not say he comes?

 Ay, that Petruchio came.

 Why, that's all one.

 You are welcome, sir.

 And yet you halt not.

 Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
First we were sad, fearing you would not come:
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

 But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.

 I'll after him, and see the event of this.

Exeunt Baptista, Gremio, and attendants,
 Is't possible you will away to-night?

 Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

 Neighbours and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table,
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place;
And let Bianca take her sister's room.

 She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.
Exeunt. 
 Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done:
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

 Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
And happily we might be interrupted.

 It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight:
And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.

 I follow you.

Exeunt Tranio, Pedant, and Baptista.
             Re-enter BIONDELLO.
     How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?

 Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

  And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
Exit.
 Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

 How like Gremio these quick-witted folks?

 O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

 Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

 Son, I'll be your half. Bianca comes.

 Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
             Re-enter KATHARINA.
 Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter,
For she is changed, as she had never been.

"
608,vin.,VINCENTIO,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-vin.," Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.

 Lucentio, gentle sir.

 But is this true? or is it else your pleasure,
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake?

 You shall not choose but drink before you go:
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
Knocks.
              Lives my sweet son?
Exeunt Biondello, Tranio, and Pedant, as fast as may be.
 Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?

   Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?

 'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.

"
609,luc.,LUCENTIO,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-luc.," Tranio, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
The pleasant garden of great Italy;
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
With his good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant, well approved in all,
Here let us breathe and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the world.
Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii.
Vincentio's son brought up in Florence
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

 Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once put us in readiness,
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: what company is this?

 But in the other's silence do I see
Maid's mild behaviour and sobriety.
Peace, Tranio!

 Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.

 O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible or likely;
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
I found the effect of love in idleness:
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as secret and as dear
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
If I achieve not this young modest girl.
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.

 Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.

 O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

 Tranio, I saw her coral lips move
And with her breath she did perfume the air:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.


 Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
But art thou not advised, he took some care
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?

 I have it, Tranio.

 Tell me thine first.

 It is: may it be done?

 Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces
For man or master; then it follows thus;
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants,as I should:
I will some other be, some Florentine,
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
'Tis hatched and shall be so: Tranio, at once
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

 Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves.
And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Here comes the rogue.
               Enter BIONDELLO.
Sirrah, where have you been?

 Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
And I for my escape have put on his;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
While I make way from hence to save my life:
You understand me?

 And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.

  Wate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
As for my patron, stand you so assured,
As firmly as yourself were still in place:
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.

 Well begun, Tranio.

 Sir, give him   head: I know he'll prove a jade.

 Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
Her sister Katharine welcomed you withal?

 Preposterous ass, that never read so far
To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his unusual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.

 That will be never: tune your instrument.

 Here, madam: 'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

  Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

 All but the base.

 Mistrust it not; for, sure, AEacides
Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.

 Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
Aside
And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.

 Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
Exit. 
 Were it not that my fellow-schoolmaster
Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.

 Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?

 Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?

 I read that I profess, the Art to Love.

 While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!

 Then we are rid of Licio.

 And what of him, Tranio?

 What sayest thou, Biondello?

 Biondello, what of that?

 I pray thee, moralize them.

 And what of him?

 And then?

 And what of all this?

 Hearest thou, Biondello?

 I may, and will, if she be so contented:
She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
Exit.
  Pardon, sweet father.

 Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio;
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes blear'd thine eyne.

 Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

 Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca.
 At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
And time it is, when raging war is done,
To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.

 I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.

 Twenty crowns.

 A hundred then.

 That will I.
Go. Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.

 I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
             Re-enter BIONDELLO.
How now! what news?

 Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.

 I would your duty were as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.

 Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.

 But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

 'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
Exeunt. 
"
610,pet.,PETRUCHIO,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-pet.," Verona, for a while I take my leave,
To see my friends in Padua, but of all
My best beloved and approved friend,
Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.

  Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

 Will it not be?
Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
He wrings him by the ears.
 Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
               Enter HORTENSIO.
 Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.

 A senseless villain. Good Hortensio,
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
And could not get him for my heart to do it.

 Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

 Such wind as scatters young men through the world
To seek their fortunes further than at home
Where small experience grows. But in a few,
Signior Hortensio, thus stands it with me:
Antonio, my father, is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
And so am come abroad to see the world.

 Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

 Hortensio, peace!   thou know'st not gold's effect:
Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
For I will board her, though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

 I know her father, though I know not her;
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter,
Unless you will accompany me thither.

 Peace, sirrah!

 I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

 Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
And I do hope good days and long to see.

 Will I live?

 Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.

 Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.

 Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

 Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.

 Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed:
The younger then is free and not before.

 And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?

 You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
Her affability and bashful modesty,
Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour,
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
I do present you with a man of mine,

Presenting Hortensio.
Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct her fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.

 I see you do not mean to part with her,
Or else you like not of my company.

 Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
A man well known throughout all Italy.

 O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

 Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
And every day I cannot come to woo.
You knew my father well, and in him me,
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?

 And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
That convenants may be kept on either hand.

 Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
And where two raging fires meet together
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
Though little fire grows great with little wind,
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
So I to her and so she yields to me;
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.

 Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
  Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke.
 Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
O, how I long to have some chat with her

 I pray you do. Exeunt all but Petruchio.
I will attend her here,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility,
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
As though she bid me stay by her a week:
If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
    Enter KATHARINA.
Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.

 You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
For daintiest are all Kates, and therefore, Kate.
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.

 Why, what's a moveable?

 Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

 Women are made to bear, and so are you.

 Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young and light--

 Should be! should--buzz!

 O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?

 Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.

 My remedy is then, to pluck it out.

 Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.

 Whose tongue?

 What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

 I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.

 A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books.

 A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

 Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.

 Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.

 Then show it me.

 What, you mean my face?

 Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

 'Tis with cares.

 Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.

 No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle conference, soft and affable.
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.

 Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

 It is extempore, from my mother-wit.

 Am I not wise?

 Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharine, in thy bed:
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And, will you, nill you, I will marry you.
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
Thou must be married to no man but me;
For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.
Here comes your father: never make denial;
I must and will have Katharine to my wife.
  Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO.
 How but well, sir? how but well?
It were impossible I should speed amiss.

 Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
If she be curst, it is for policy,
For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

 Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That she shall still be curst in company.
I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
That in a twink she won me to her love.
O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
How tame, when men and women are alone,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Katharine shall be fine.

 Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
We will have rings and things and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o' Sunday.
Exeunt Petruchio and Katharina severally.
 Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?

 And yet I come not well.

 Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
As if they saw some wondrous monument,
Some comet or unusual prodigy?

 Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth, I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal.
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.

 Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.

 Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
Could I repair what she will wear in me,
As I can change these poor accoutrements,
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,.
And seal the title with a lovely kissl

Exeunt Petruchio and Grumio.
 Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
I know you think to dine with me to-day,
And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.

 I must away to-day, before night come:
Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
You would entreat me rather go than stay.
And, honest company, I thank you all,
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
For I must hence; and farewell to you all.

 It may not be.

 It cannot be.

 I am content.

 I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

 Grumio, my horse.

 O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.

 They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be master of what is mine own:
She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
My household stuff, my field, my barn,
My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man,
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee, Kate:
I'll buckler thee against a million.

Exeunt Petruchio, Katharina, and Grumio.
 Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?

 Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?

 You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?

 Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
Exeunt Servants.
Singing
Where is the life that late I led--
Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
Soud, soud, soud, soud!
Re-enter Servants with supper.
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
Sings
It was the friar of orders grey,
As he forth walked on his way:--
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
Strikes him. 
Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acqainted with.
Where are my slippers?   Shall I have some water?
            Enter one with water.
Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
Strikes him.
 A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
What's this? mutton?

 Who brought it?

 'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
How durst you, villains, bring it from   the dresser,
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
There, take it to you, trenchers, cups, and all:
Throws the meat, &c. about the stage.
You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble?   I'll be with you straight.

 I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
Than fed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; tomorrow 't shall be mended,
And, for this night, we'll fast for company.
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
Exeunt.
          Re-enter Servants severally.
 He kills her in her own humour,
                Re-enter CURTIS.
 Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
For then she never looks upon her lure.
Another way I have to man my haggard,
To make her come and know her keeper's call,
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed;
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
That all is done in reverend care of her;
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.
Exit.
 How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

 Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Here, love; thou see'st how diligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
Here, take away this dish.

 The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.

 Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart
Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
We will return unto thy father's house
And revel it as bravely as the best,
With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;
With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery;
What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
                 Enter Tailor.
Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
Lay forth the gown.
              Enter Haberdasher.
What news with you, sir?

 Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.

 When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
And not till then.
 Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.

 Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see 't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demicannon:
What, up and down, carved like an appletart?
Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
Why, what i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
 Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, hop me over every kennel home,
For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.

 Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.

 O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest,
thou thread, thou thimble,
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
As thou shall think on prating whilst thou livest!
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.

 Read it.

 Proceed.
 Ay, there's the villany.

 Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

 Go, take it up unto thy master's use.

 Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?

 Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.

 Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
Even in these honest mean habiliments:
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
What is the jay more precious than the lark,
Because his feathers are more beautiful?
Or is the adder better than the eel,
Because his painted skin contents the eye?
O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array,
If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me;
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may come there by dinner-time.

 It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
 Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!

 I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

 Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!

 I say it is the moon.

 Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.

 Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
And not unluckily against the bias.
But, soft! company is coming here.
               Enter VINCENTIO.
To Vincentio
Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.

 Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.

 Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
We shall be joyful of thy company.

 What is his name?

 Happily met; the happier for thy son.
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
I may entitle thee my loving father:
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
Nor be not grieved: she is of good esteem,
Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
Beside, so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman.
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

 Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
Exeunt all but Hortensio. 
 Sir, here 's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My father's bears more toward the marketplace;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.

    First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

 What, art thou ashamed of me?

 Why, then, let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.

 Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.
Exeunt,
 Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!

 Padua affords nothing but what is kind.

 Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

 You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.

 Roundly replied.

 Conceives by me!   How likes Hortensio that?

 Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

 To her, Kate!

 A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

 Spoke like an officer: ha' to thee, lad!
Drinks to Hortensio.
 Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
Have at you for a bitter jest or two!

 She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.

 A good swift simile, but something currish.

 A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.

 Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
Let's each one send unto his wife;
And he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first when he doth send for her,
Shall win the wager which we will propose.

 Twenty crowns!
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
But twenty times so much upon my wife.

 A match! 'tis done.

 How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?

 I hope, better.

 O, ho! entreat her!
Nay, then she must needs come.

 Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be endured!
Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
Say, I command her come to me.
Exit Grumio.
 What?

 The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.

 Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?

 Go, fetch them hither: if they deny to come,
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
Exit Katharina.
 Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life:
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?

 Nay, I will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of her obedience,
Her new-built virtue and obedience.

See where she comes and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
   Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow
Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.

 Katharine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.

 Come on, I say; and first begin with her.

 I say she shall: and first begin with her.

 Why, there's a wench!   Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

 Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
To Luc.
'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
And, being a winner, God give you good night!
Exeunt Petruchio and Katharina. 
"
611,gre.,GREMIO,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-gre.," To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?

 And me too, good Lord!

 Why will you mew her up,
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?

       O, very well; I have perused the note.
Hark you, sir; I'll have them very fairly bound:
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to her:
You understand me: over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
And let me have them very well perfumed:
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?

 O this learning, what a thing it is

 And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promised to inquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man, for learning and behaviour
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

 Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.

 So said, so done, is well.
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

 No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?

 O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?

 Hortensio, hark:
This gentleman is happily arrived,
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.

 And so we will, provided that he win her.

 Hark you, sir: you mean not her to--

 No; if without more words you will get you hence.

 But so is not she.

 For this reason, if you'll know,
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.

 What this gentleman will out-talk us all.

 Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.

  You are too blunt: go to it orderly.

 Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
Beccare! you are marvellous forward.

  Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee hang'd first.

 (with Tra.) Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.

 Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?

 No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter:
Now is the day we long have looked for:
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.

 Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

 But thine doth fry.
Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

 First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands:
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
Pewter and brass and all things that belong
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
And all things answerable to this portion.
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
If whilst I live she will be only mine.

 Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all:
That she shall have; besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles road.
What, have I choked you with an argosy?

 Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
And she can have no more than all I have:
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.

 And may not young men die, as well as old?

 Adieu, good neighbour.
Exit Baptista.
Now I fear thee not:
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
To give thee all, and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

Exit.
 As willingly as e'er I came from school.

 A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.

 Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.

 Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
Should ask, if Katharine should be his wife,
'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'

 Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done, he took the bride about the neck
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
Such a mad marriage never was before:
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.
Music.
Re-enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA,
BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO, GRUMIO, and Train.
 Let me entreat you.

 Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

 Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.

 I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.

 I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, VINCENTIO,
GRUMIO, with Attendants.
      Here's packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!

 My cake is dough; but I'll be among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
Exit.
 Believe me. sir, they butt together well.

 Ay, and a kind one too:
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

"
612,hor.,HORTENSIO,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-hor.," Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.

 From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!

 Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Bianca's grief.

       'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto
honorato signor mio Petruchio.'
Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound this quarrel.

 Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

 Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou 'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
And very rich: but thou't too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.

 Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
Is that she is intolerable curst
And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
That, were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

 Her father is Baptista Minola,
An affable and courteous gentleman:
Her name is Katharina Minola,
Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

 Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,
And her withholds from me and other more,
Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
Supposing it a thing impossible,
For those defects I have before rehearsed,
That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katharine the curst have got a husband.

 Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
And offer me disguised in sober robes
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
That so I may, by this device, at least
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected court her by herself.

  Grumio, mum!   God save you, Signior Gremio.

 'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
Hath promised me to help me to another,
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.

 Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
Upon agreement from us to his liking,
Will undertake to woo curst Katharine,
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

 I promised we would be contributors
And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.

 Sir, a word ere you go;
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?

 That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

 Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?

 Sir, you say well and well do you conceive;
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
To whom we all rest generally beholding.

 The motion's good indeed and be it so,
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.
Exeunt.
 For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

 I think she'll sooner prove a soldier:
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

 Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume with them:'
And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
And through the instrument my pate made way;
And there I stood amazed for a while,
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
As had she studied to misuse me so.

 But, wrangling pedant, this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony:
Then give me leave to have prerogative;
And when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.

 Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.

 You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

 Madam, my instrument's in tune.

 Madam, 'tis now in tune.

 The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
Aside
How fiery and forward our pedant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

 You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
My lessons make no music in three parts.

 Madam, before you touch the instrument,
To learn the order of my fingering,
I must begin with rudiments of art;
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

 Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
 But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
Exit.
 Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO.
 Quick, proceeders, marry!   Now, tell me, I pray,
You that durst swear that your mistress Bianca
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.

 Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
And makes a god of such a cullion:
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.

 See, how they kiss and court Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.

 Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.
Exit.
 Mistress, what cheer?

 Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
Come, Mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
 That will not be in haste.

 I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.

 God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.

 Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
Away! I say; commend me to thy master.
Exit Tailor.
 Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
Exeunt. 
 Say as he says, or we shall never go.

 Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.

 A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

 I do assure thee, father, so it is.

 Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
Exit. 
 For both our sakes, I would that word were true.

 My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.

 To her, widow!

 That's my office.

 Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?

 Content. What is the wager?

 Content.

 Who shall begin?

 Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
To come to me forthwith.
Exit Bion.
 I am afraid, sir,
Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
              Re-enter BIONDELLO.
Now, where's my wife?

 I know her answer.

 She will not.

 And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.

 Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

"
613,tra.,TRANIO,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-tra.," Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

 Master, some show to welcome us to town.
 Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by.
 Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

 Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

 I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold?

 Master, it is no time to chide you now;
Affection is not rated from the heart:
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

 Master you look'd so longly on the maid,
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.

 Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

 Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid.
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the father rid his hands of her,
Master, your love must live a maid at home;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.


 Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.


 Master, for my hand,
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

  You will be schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of the maid:
That's your device.

 Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
Visit his countrymen and banquet them?

 So had you need.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
And I am tied to be obedient;
Because so well I love Lucentio.
For so your father charged me at our parting,
'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in another sense;
I am content to be Lucentio.
Because so well I love Lucentio.

 So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's,
 I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
But in all places else your master Lucentio.

 Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptisa Minola?

 Even he, Biondello.

 Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?

 I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.

 And if I be, sir, is it any offence?

 Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you?

 For what reason, I beseech you?

 Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
Do me this right; hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not all unknown;
And were his daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitors have and me for one.
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

 No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.

 If it be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
And if you break the ice and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

 Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
And do as adversaries do in law,
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

 Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
That being a stranger in this city here.
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the education of your daughters,
I here bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their worth is great.

 Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.

 Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!

 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

 And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.

 Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.

 But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

 That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only son:
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or four as good.
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

 Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
And twelve tight galleys: these will I assure her,
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.

 Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.

 That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

 A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
Exit.
 Patience, good Katharine, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.

 But say, what to thine old news?

 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

 Not so well apparell'd
As I wish you were.

 And tells  us, what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?

 See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; put on clothes of mine.

 He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.

 But to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass
As I before imparted to your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much, we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
And make assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.

 That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our vantage in this business:
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
               Re-enter GREMIO.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

 And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

 Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.

 Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.

 What said the wench when he rose again?

 Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

 Of all mad matches never was the like.

 Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?

 Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

 O despiteful love! unconstant womankind
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

 Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since my eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

 And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!

 Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

 Mistress, we have.

 I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day.

 Ay, and he'll tame her.

 Faith, he is gone unto the tamingschool.

 Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
               Enter BIONDELLO.
                What is he, Biondello?

 If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he were the right Vincentio.
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca.
                 Enter a Pedant.
          And you, sir! you are welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?

 What countryman, I pray?

 Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your life?

 'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

 Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

 Among them know you one Vincentio?

 He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
 To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Look that you take upon you as you should;
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city:
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.

 Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
My father is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

Exeunt.
 Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?

 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.

 Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty thoroughly, I advise you:
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.

 But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

 Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
 Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO.

Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
To the Pedant
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
I pray you, stand good father to me now,
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

 I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied and such assurance ta'en
And shall with either part's agreement stand?

 Then at my lodging, an it like you:
There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here;
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

 Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.

>Exit Bion. 
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.

 Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

 How now! what's the matter?

    O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
Which runs himself and catches for his master.

 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

"
614,bion.,BIONDELLO,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-bion.,"  I, sir! ne'er a whit.

 The better for him: would I were so too!

    Why, no, sir.

 He is coming.

 When he stands where I am and sees you there.

   Why, sir, he comes not.

 Who? that Petruchio came?

 No, sir; I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

 Nay, by Saint Jamy,
I hold you a penny,
A horse and a man
Is more than one,
And yet not many.
Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO.
 O master, master, I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.

 Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not what; but formal in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.

 As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one.

 Tut, fear not me.

 I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.

 I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

 Cambio!

 You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

     If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say,
But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day.

  Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.

        Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.

 I go.
Exit.
 Sir, my mistress sends you word
That she is busy and she cannot come.

 She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come; she bids you come to her.

"
615,gru.,GRUMIO,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-gru.,"   My master is grown quarrelsome.   I should knock you first,
And then I know after who comes by the worst.

  Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first,
Then had not Grumio come by the worst.

    Katharine the curst!
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

   O this woodcock, what an ass it is!

 And that his bags shall prove.

 Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.

 For he fears none.

 I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO.
 (with Bion.) O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

           Out of their saddles into the dirt;
and thereby hangs a tale.

              Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.

  No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.

 What say you to a neat's foot?

 I fear it is too choleric a meat.
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

 I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

 Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

 Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

 Why then, the mustard without the beef.

 I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.

 Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

 Thou hast faced many things.

  The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
  I confess the cape.
 I confess two sleeves.
   You are i' the right, sir; 'tis for my mistress.

 Villain, not for thy life: take up my
mistress' gown for thy master's use!

 O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
O, fie, fie, fie!
"
616,curt.,CURTIS,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-curt.," Who is that calls so coldly?

           This is to feel a tale, not to hear a  tale.

   By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.

     In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
Away, away! for he is coming hither.
Exeunt.
             Re-enter PETRUCHIO.
"
617,nath.,Nathaniel,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-nath.," Welcome home, Grumio!

  All things is ready. How near is our master?

 Peter, didst ever see the like?

"
618,phil.,Philip,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-phil.," How now, Grumio!

"
619,jos.,Joseph,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-jos., 
620,nich.,Nicholas,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-nich., 
622,kath.,KATHARINA,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-kath.," I pray you, sir, is it your will
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?

 I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
I wis it is not half way to her heart;
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool.

 A pretty peat! it is best
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.

  Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.

 Minion, thou liest.   Is't not Hortensio?

 O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.

 If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
Strikes her.
Enter BAPTISTA.
 Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
Flies after Bianca. 
 What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.
Exit.
 Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call my Katharine that do talk of me.

 Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.

 A join'd-stool.

 Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

 No such jade as you, if me you mean.

 Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

 Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

 Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

 If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

 Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.

 In his tongue.

 Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.

 That I'll try.
She strikes him. 
 So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.

 What is your crest? a coxcomb?

 No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.

 It is my fashion, when I see a crab.

 There is, there is.

 Had I a glass, I would.

 Well aim'd of such a young one.

 Yet you are wither'd.

 I care not.

 I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.

 Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

 Where did you study all this goodly speech?

 A witty mother! witless else her son.

 Yes; keep you warm.

 Call you me daughter? now, I promise you,
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

 I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

 No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour:
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Now must the world point at poor Katharine,
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'

 Would Katharine had never seen him though!
Exit weeping, followed by Bianca and others.
 Let me entreat you.

 Are you content to stay?

 Now, if you love me, stay.

 Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.

 I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet: he shall stay my leisure.

 Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit to resist.

 Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.

 I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you were so contented.

 The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that come unto my father's door
Upon entreaty have a present alms;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that which spites me more than all these wants,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

 'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.

 I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.

 A dish that I do love to feed upon.

 Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.

 Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.

 Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
Beats him.
That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
That triumph thus upon my misery
Go, get thee gone, I say.
Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat.
 Faith, as cold as can be.

 I pray you, let it stand.

 I thank you, sir.

 I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.

 Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears,
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart concealing it will break,
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

 Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none.

Exit Haberdasher.
 I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

 I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.

 The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.

 I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

 Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
And if you please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.

 I know it is the moon.

 Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
And the moon changes even as your mind.
What you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it shall be so for Katharine.

 Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man, whom favourable stars
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!

 Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green:
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

 Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.

 What, in the midst of the street?

 No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.

 Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.

 Mistress, how mean you that?

 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.

 A very mean meaning.

 And I am mean indeed, respecting you.

 What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

 They sit conferring by the parlour fire.

 Fie, fie!   unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, they sovereign; one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I am ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace,
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

"
623,bian.,BIANCA,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-bian.," Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to look and practise by myself.

 Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.

 Believe, me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.

 If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.

 Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

 Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

 Where left we last?

 Construe them.

 Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.

  In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

 I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

 Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

 ""'Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
'A re,' to plead Hortensio's passion;
'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.""
Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:
Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
To change true rules for old inventions.
                Enter a Servant.
 Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.
Exeunt Bianca and Servant. 
 That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

 What, master, read you? first resolve me that.

 And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

 Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?

 God give him joy!

 He says so, Tranio.

 The taming-school! what, is there such a place?

 Pardon, dear father.

 Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

 Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

 Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.
Exeunt Bianca, Katharina, and Widow.
 Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?

 The more fool you, for laying on my duty.

"
624,wid.,Widow,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-wid.," Then never trust me, if I be afeard.

 He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.

 Thus I conceive by him.

 Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
And now you know my meaning.

 Right, I mean you.

 Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!

 Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.

 She shall not.

"
626,tai.,Tailor,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-tai.," You bid me make it orderly and well,
According to the fashion and the time.

 She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.

 Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
Just as my master had direction:
Grumio gave order how it should be done.

 But how did you desire it should be made?

 But didst you not request to have it cut?

 I have.

 Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.

 'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'

 'With a small compassed cape:'

 'With a trunk sleeve:'

 Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.

 What follows if we disallow of this?

 Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
Controlment for controlment:  so answer France.

 Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
For ere thou canst report I will be there,
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:
So hence!   Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
And sullen presage of your own decay.
An honorable conduct let him have:
Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.
[Exeunt Chatillon and Pembroke.
 Our strong possession and our right for us.

 Let them approach.
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
This expedition's charge.
Enter ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE, and PHILIP his bastard brother.
What men are you?

 What art thou?

 Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
You came not of one mother then, it seems.

 A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?

 Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!

 Mine eye hath well examined his parts
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?

 Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him.
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's.
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
Being none of his, refuse him; this concludes;
My mother's son did get your father's heir;
Your father's heir must have your father's land.

 What is thy name?

 From henceforth bear his name
whose form thou bear'st:
Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.

 Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
For France, for France, for it is more than need.

 Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
Our just and lineal entrance to our own;
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct
Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.

 From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
To draw my answer from thy articles?

 Alack, thou dost usurp authority.

 My life as soon: do defy thee, France.
Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:
Submit thee, boy.

 Bedlam, have done.

 England, for itself.
You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects,--

 For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
These flags of France, that are advanced here
Before the eye and prospect of your town,
Have hither march'd to your endamagement:
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
All preparation for a bloody siege
And merciless proceeding by these French
Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
That as a waist doth girdle you about,
By the compulsion of their ordinance
By this time from their fixed beds of lime
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
But on the sight of us your lawful king,
Who painfully with much expedient march
Have brought a countercheck before your gates,
To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,
Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
To make a shaking fever in your walls,
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
To make a faithless error in your ears:
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
And let us in, your king, whose labor'd spirits,
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
Crave harborage within your city walls.

 Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.

 Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
And if not that, I bring you witnesses,
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--

 To verify our title with their lives.

 Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
That to their everlasting residence,
Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,
In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!

 Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth
In best appointment all our regiments.

 France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
Say, shall the current of our right run on?
Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,
Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,
Unless thou let his silver water keep
A peaceful progress to the ocean.

 Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?

 In us, that are our own great deputy,
And bear possession of our person here,
Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.

 Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers
And lay this Angiers even with the ground;
Then after fight who shall be king of it?

 We from the west will send destruction
Into this city's bosom.

 Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.

 If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen;
For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,
And all that we upon this side the sea,
Except this city now by us besieged,
Find liable to our crown and dignity,
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
In titles, honours and promotions,
As she in beauty, education, blood,
Holds hand with any princess of the world.

 What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?

 Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?

 Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,
With her to thee; and this addition more,
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.

 We will heal up all;
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;
Some speedy messenger bid her repair
To our solemnity: I trust we shall,
If not fill up the measure of her will,
Yet in some measure satisfy her so
That we shall stop her exclamation.
Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.
[Exeunt all but the Bastard.
 We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.
Enter PANDULPH.
 What earthly name to interrogatories
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,
To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,
So under Him that great supremacy,
Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
So tell the pope, all reverence set apart
To him and his usurp'd authority.

 Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
Though you and all the rest so grossly led
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
Against the pope and count his friends my foes.

 Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?

 The king is moved, and answers not to this.

 France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.

 Cousin, go draw our puissance together.       [Exit Bastard. 
France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;
A rage whose heat hath this condition,
That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,
The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.

 No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!        [Exeunt.  Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:
My mother is assailed in our tent,
And ta'en, I fear.

 So shall it be; your grace shall stay behind
So strongly guarded. [To Arthur] Cousin,
look not sad:
Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle will
As dear be to thee as thy father was.

  Cousin, away
for England! haste before:
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels
Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace
Must by the hungry now be fed upon:
Use our commission in his utmost force.

 Coz, farewell.   [Exit Bastard.
 Come hither, Hubert, O my gentle Hubert.
We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh
There is a soul counts thee her creditor
And with advantage means to pay thy love:
And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,
But I will fit it with some better t'me.
By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed
To say what good respect I have of thee.

 Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
I had a thing to say, but let it jo:
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
Attended with the pleasures of the world,
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
To give me audience: if the midnight bell
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
Sound on into the drowsy race of night:
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment
A passion hateful to my purposes,
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;
And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.

   Do not I know thou wouldst?
Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
On yon young boy:  I'll tell thee what, my friend,
He is a very serpent in my way;
And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,
He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
Thou art his keeper.

 Death.

 A grave.

 Enough.
I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;
Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:
Remember. Madam, fare you well:
I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.

 For England, cousin, go:
Hubert shall be your man, attend on you
With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!    [Exeunt. Here once again we sit, once again crowned,
And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.

 Some reasons of this double coronation
I have possess'd you with and think them strong;
And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
What you would have reform'd that is not well,
And well shall you perceive how willingly
I will both hear and grant you your request.

 Let it be so: I do commit his youth
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?  [Taking him apart.] 
 We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
Good lords, although my will to give is living,
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.

 Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?

 They burn in indignation.   I repent:
There is no sure foundation set on blood,
No certain life achieved by others' death.
Enter a Messenger.
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
Pour down thy weather: how   goes all in France?

 O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
Where hath it slept?   Where is my mother's care,
That such an army could be drawn in France,
And she not hear of it?

 Withhold   thy speed, dreadful occasion I
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
My discontented peers! WhatI mother deadly
How wildly then walks my estate in France!
Under whose conduct came those powers of France
That thou for truth givest out are landed here?

 Thou hast made me giddy
With these ill tidings.
Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret.
Now, what says the world
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
My head with more ill news, for it is full.

 Bear with me, cousin; for I was amazed
Under the tide: but now I breathe again
Aloft the flood, and can give audience
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.

 Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?

 Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
And on that day at noon, whereon he says
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.
Deliver him to safety; and return,
For I must use thee.
[Exeunt Hubert with Peter.
O my gentle cousin,
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived ?

 Gentle kinsman, go,
And thrust thyself into their companies:
I have a way to win their loves again;
Bring them before me.

 Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
O, let me have no subject enemies,
When adverse foreigners affright my towns
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
And fly like thought from them to me again.

 Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
And be thou he.

 My mother dead!
Re-enter HUBERT.
 Five moons!

 Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.

 It is the curse of kings to be attended
By slaves that take their humors for a warrant
To break within the bloody house of life,
And on the winking of authority
To understand a law, to know the meaning
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
More upon humor than advised respect.

 O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation!
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
Quoted and signed to do a deed of shame,
This murder had not come into my mind:
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
And thou, to be endeared to a king,
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.

 Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
When I spake darkly what I purposed,
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
As bid me tell my tale in express words,
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
But thou didst understand me by my signs
And didst in signs again parley with sin;
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
And consequently thy rude hand to act
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
Out of my sight, and never see me more!
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
Hostility and civil tumult reigns
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.

 Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
Throw this report on their incensed rage,
And make them tame to their obedience!
Forgive the comment that my passion made
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
O, answer not, but to my closet bring
The angry lords with all expedient haste.
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
[Exeunt. Thus have I yielded up into your hand
The circle of my glory.
[Giving the crown.
 Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
And from his holiness use all your power
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.
Our discontented counties do revolt;
Our people quarrel with obedience,
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
This inundation of mistemper'd humor
Rests by you only to be qualified:
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
That present medicine must be minister'd,
Or overthrow incurable ensues.

 Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
Say that before Ascension-day at noon
My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
I did suppose it should be on constraint:
But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.
Enter the BASTARD.
 Would not my lords return to me again,
After they heard young Arthur was alive?

 That villain Hubert told me he did live.

 The legate of the pope hath been with me,
And I have made a happy peace with him;
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
Led by the Dauphin.

 Have thou the ordering of this present time

 How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.

 This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
Enter a Messenger.
 Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.

 Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,
And will not let me welcome this good news.
Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;
Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
                 [Exeunt. Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
It would not out at windows nor at doors.
There is so hot a summer in my bosom,
That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
Upon a parchment, and against this fire
Do I shrink up.

 Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:
And none of you will bid the winter come
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,
I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
And so ingrateful, you deny me that.

 The salt in them is hot.
Within me is a hell; and there the poison
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
On unreprievable condemned blood.
Enter the BASTARD.
 O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
Are turned to one thread, one little hair:
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
And then all this thou seest is but a clod
And module of confounded royalty.

"

Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,

 Let him be brought into the orchard here.
Doth he still rage?
                 [Exit Bigot.
 O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
In their continuance will not feel themselves.
Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
Against the mind, the which he pricks andt wounds
With many legions of strange fantasies,
Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death should sing.
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
His soul and body to their lasting rest.

 How fares your majesty?

 O that there were some virtue in my tears,
That might relieve you!

 Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
When this was now a king, and now is clay?

 At Worcester must his body be interred;
For so he will'd it.

 I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
And knows not how to do it but with tears.

"
687,arth.,"ARTHUR, Duke of Bretagne",Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-arth.," God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
The rather that you give his offspring life,
Shadowing their right under your wings of war:
I give you welcome with a powerless hand,
But with a heart full of unstained love:
Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.

 Good my mother, peace!
I would that I were low laid in my grave:
I am not worth this coil that's made for me.

 I do beseech you, madam, be content.

 O, this will make my mother die with grief!

 Good morrow, Hubert.

 As little prince, having so great a title
To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.

 Mercy on me!
Methinks no body should be sad but I:
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
I should be as merry as the day is long;
And so I would be here, but that I doubt
My uncle practises more harm to me:
He is afraid of me and I of him:
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
No, indeed, is 't not; and I would to heaven
I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.

 Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:
In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
That I might sit all night and watch with you:
I warrant I love you more than you do me.

 Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?

 And will you?

 Have you the heart?   When your head did but ache,
I knit my handkerchief about your brows,
The best I had, a princess wrought it me,
And I did never ask it you again;
And with my hand at midnight held your head,
And like the watchful minutes to the hour,
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
Saying 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'
Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
Many a poor man's son would have lien still
And ne'er have spoken a loving word to you;
But you at your sick service had a prince.
Nay, you may think my love was crafty love
And call it cunning: do, an if you will:
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,
Why then you must. Will you put out mine   eyes?
These eyes that never did nor never shall
So much as frown on you.

 Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears
And quench his fiery indignation
Even in the matter of mine innocence;
Nay, after that, consume away in rust,
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.

 O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.

 Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough ?
I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.
For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word.
Nor look upon the iron angerly:
Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,
Whatever torment you do put me to.

 Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:
Let him come back, that his compassion may
Give life to yours.

 Is there no remedy?

 O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
Any annoyance in that precious sense!
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.

 Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:
Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;
Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue
So I may keep mine eyes; O, spare mine eyes,
Though to no use but still to look on you!
Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold
And would not harm me.

 No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
Being create for comfort, to be used
In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;
There is no malice in this burning coal;
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.

 An if you do, you will but make it blush
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:
Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
All things that you should use to do me wrong
Deny their office: only you do lack
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,
Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.

 O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
You were disguised.

 O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.

 The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
There's few or none do know me: if they did,
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
I am afraid; and yet I 'll venture it.
If I get down, and do not break my limbs,
I'll find a thousand shifts to ge away:
As good to die and go, as die and stay.
[Leaps down.
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:
Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!
[Dies. 
Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT.
"
688,pem.,The Earl of PEMBROKE,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-pem.," This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
Fresh expectation troubled not the land
With any long'd-for change or better state.

 But that your royal pleasure must be done,
This act is as an ancient tale new told,
And in the last repeating troublesome,
Being urged at a time unseasonable.

 When workmen strive to do better than well,
They do confound their skill in covetousness;
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
As patches set upon a little breach
Piscredit more in hiding of the fault
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.

 Then I, as one that am the tongue of these
To sound the purposes of all their hearts,
Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,
Your safety, for the which myself and them
Bend their best studies, heartily request
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
To break into this dangerous argument,--
If what in rest you have in right you hold,
Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend
The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
The rich advantage of good exercise?
That the time's enemies may not have this
To grace occasions, let it be our suit
That you have bid us ask his liberty;
Which for our goods we do no further ask
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
Enter HUBERT.
 This is the man should do the bloody deed;
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
The image of a wicked heinous fault
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
What we so feared he had a charge to do.

 And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.

 Indeed we heard how near his death he was
Before the child himself felt he was sick:
This must be answer'd either here or hence.

 Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,
And find the inheritance of this poor child,
His little kingdom of a forced grave.
That blood which owed the breath of all this isle,
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
This must not be thus borne: this will break out
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.  [Exeunt Lords.
 Who brought that letter from the cardinal ?

 Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.

 O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.

 All murders past do stand excused in this:
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
Shall give a holiness, a purity,
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.

 Cut him to pieces.

 There tell the king he may inquire us out.
[Exeunt Lords. 
 Up once again; put spirit in the French:
If they miscarry, we miscarry too.

 They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
Enter MELUN, wounded.
 It is the Count Melun.

 His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
That, being brought into the open air,
It would allay the burning quality
Of that fell poison which assaileth him.

 He is more patient
Than when you left him; even now he sung.

"
689,sal.,The Earl of SALISBURY,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-sal.," As true as I believe you think them false
That give you cause to prove my saying true.

 What other harm have I, good lady, done,
But spoke the harm that is by others done?

 Pardon me, madam,
I may not go without you to the kings.

 Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
To guard a title that was rich before,
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
To throw a perfume on the violet,
To smooth the ice, or add another hue
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.

 In this the antique and well noted face
Of plain old form is much disfigured;
And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
Startles and frights consideration,
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.

 To this effect, before you were new crown'd,
We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness
To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,
Since all and every part of what we would
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.

 The colour of the king doth come and go
Between his purpose and his conscience,
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set
His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.

 Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.

 It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame
That greatness should so grossly offer it:
So thrive it in your game   and so, farewell.

 Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:
It is our safety, and we must embrace
This gentle offer of the perilous time.

 The Count Melun, a noble lord of France;
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
Is much more general than these lines import.

 Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.
Enter the BASTARD.
 The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
We will not line his thin bestained cloak
With our pure honors, nor attend the foot
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
Return and tell him so: we know the worst.

 Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.

 This is the prison. What is he lies here?
[Seeing Arthur. 
 Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.

 Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
Or have you read or heard? or could you think ?
Or do you almost think, although you see,
That you do see? could thought, without this object,
Form such another?   This is the very top,
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.

 If that it be the work of any hand!
We had a kind of light what would ensue:
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
The practice and the purpose of the king:
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
And breathing to his breathless excellence
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
Never to be infected with delight,
Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
Till I have set a glory to this hand,
By giving it the worship of revenge.

 O, he is bold and blushes not at death.
Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!

 Must I rob the law?
                      [Drawing his sword.
 Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.

 Thou art a murderer.

 Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.

 Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
For villany is not without such rheum;
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
The uncleanly savors of a slaughter-house;
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.

 Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,
I am not glad that such a sore of time
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
By making many. O, it grieves my soul,
That I must draw this metal from my side
To be a widow-maker! O, and there
Where honorable rescue and defence
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
But such is the infection of the time,
That, for the health and physic of our right,
We cannot deal but with the very hand
Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
And is't not pity, O my grieved friend,
That we, the sons and children of this isle,
Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
Wherein we step after a stranger march
Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep
Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--
To grace the gentry of a land remote,
And follow unacquainted colors here?
What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;
Where these two Christian armies might combine
The blood of malice in a vein of league,
And not to spend it so unneighborly!

 I did not think the king so stored with friends.

 That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.

 When we were happy we had other names.

 Wounded to death.

 May this be possible? may this be true?

 We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
But I do love the favor and the form
Of this most fair occasion, by the which
We will untread the steps of damned flight,
And like a bated and retired flood,
Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
And calmly run on in obedience
Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
For I do see the cruel pangs of death
Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
And happy newness, that intends old right.
                 [Exeunt, leading off Melun. Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
To set a form upon that indigest
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair.
 You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.

 It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
And brings from him such offers of our peace
As we with honor and respect may take,
With purpose presently to leave this war.

 Nay, it is in a manner done already;
For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
To the disposing of the cardinal:
With whom yourself, myself and other lords,
If you think meet, this afternoon will post
To consummate this business happily.

 And the like tender of our love we make,
To rest without a spot for evermore.

"
690,big.,The Lord BIGOT,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-big.," To-morrow morning let us meet him then.

 Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
Found it too precious-princely for a grave.

 Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?

 What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
Second a villain and a murderer?

 Who kill'd this prince?

 Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!

"
691,hub.,HUBERT DE BURGH,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-hub.," I am much bounden to your majesty,

 So well, that what you bid me undertake,
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
By heaven, I would do it.

 And I'll keep him so,
That he shall not offend your majesty.

 My lord?

 He shall not live.

 Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
Within the arras: when I strike my foot
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.

 Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to 't.
[Exeunt Executioners. 
Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
Enter ARTHUR.
 Good morrow, little prince..

 Indeed, I have been merrier.

 If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
He will awake my mercy which lies dead:
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.

 His words do take possession of my bosom.
Read here, young Arthur.  [Showing a paper.
[Aside]How now, foolish rheum!
'Turning dispiteous torture out of door
I must be brief, lest resolution drop
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
Can you not read it? is it not fair writ?

 Young boy, I must.

 And I will.

 I have sworn to do it;
And with hot irons must I burn them out.

 Come forth.        [Stamps.
Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, iron, &c.
Do as I bid you do.

 Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.

 Go, stand within; let me alone with him.

 Come, boy, prepare yourself.

 None, but to lose your eyes.

 Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.

 I can heat it, boy.

 But with my breath I can revive it, boy.

 Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
With this same very iron to burn them out.

 Peace; no more. Adieu.
Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
Will not offend thee.

 Silence; no more: go closely in with me:
Much danger do I undergo for thee.
[Exeunt. My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
The other four in wondrous motion.

 Old men and beldams in the streets
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
And whisper one another in the ear;
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
I saw a smith stand wth his hammer, thus,
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
Told of a many thousand warlike French
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:
Another lean unwash'd artificer
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.

 No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?

 Here is your hand and seal for what I did.

 My lord,-

 Arm you against your other enemies,
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
Within this bosom never enter'd yet
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
And you have slander'd nature in my form,
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.

 Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:
Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.

 I am no villain.

 Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:
I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
Your worth, your greatness and nobility.

 Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
My innocent life against an emperor.

 Do not prove me so;
Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.

 Lord Bigot, I am none.

 'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
I honor'd him, I loved him, and will weep
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.

 Do but hear me, sir.

 Upon my soul--

 If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
I left him well.

 Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty ?

 Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.

 Of the part of England.

 What's that to thee? why may not I demand
Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?

 Thou hast a perfect thought:
I will upon all hazards well believe
Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.
Who art thou?

 Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,
That any accent breaking from thy tongue
Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.

 Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
To find you out.

 O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.

 The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:
I left him almost speechless; and broke out
To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
The better arm you to the sudden time,
Than if you had at leisure known of this.

 A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king
Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.

 Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
And brought Prince Henry in their company;
At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
And they are all about his majesty.

"
692,rob.,ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-rob.," The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.

 My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
Your brother did employ my father much.--

 And once dispatched him in an embassy
To Germany, there with the emperor
To treat of high affairs touching that time.
The advantage of his absence took the king
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
Between my father and my mother lay,
As I have heard my father speak himself,
When this same lusty gentleman was got.
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
His lands to me, and took it on his death
That this my mother's son was none of his;
And if he were, he came into the world
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time,
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
My father's land, as was my father's will.

 Shall then my father's will be of no force
To dispossess that child which is not his?

"
693,bast.,PHILIP the BASTARD,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-bast.," Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge.
A soldier, by the honor-giving hand
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.

 Most certain of one mother, mighty king,
That is well known; and, as I think, one father:
But for the certain knowledge of that truth
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.

 I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
Heaven guard my mother's honor and my land!

 I know not why, except to get the land,
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
But whether I be as true begot or no,
That still I lay upon my mother's head;
But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
If old sir Robert did beget us both
And were our father and this son like him,
O old sir Robert, father, on my knee
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!

 Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
With half that face would he have all my land:
A half-faced groat five hundred pounds a year!

 Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.

 Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
Than was his will to get me, as I think.

 Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
My arm such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
Would I might never stir from off this place,
I would give it every foot to have this face;
I would not be sir Nob in any case.

 Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
Madam, I'll follow   you unto the death.

 Our country manners give our betters way.

 Philip, my liege, so is my name begun;
Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.

 Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,
When I was got, sir Robert was away!

 Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
Something about, a little from the right,
In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
And have is have, however men do catch:
Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
And I am I, however I was begot.

 Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
[Exeunt all but Bastard.
A fool or honour better than I was;
But many a many foot of land the worse.
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
'Good den, sir Richard!--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
For new-made honour doth forget men's names;
'Tis too respective and too sociable
For your conversion. Now your traveller,
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;
And then comes answer like an Absey book:
'O yes,' says answer, 'at your best command;
At your employment; at your service, sir:'
'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:
And so, ere answer knows what question would,
Saving a dialogue of compliment,
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
The Pyrenean and the river Po,
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
But this is worshipful society
And fits the mounting spirit like myself:
For he is but a bastard to the time
That doth not smack of observation;
And so am I, whether I smack or no;
And not alone in habit and device,
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
But from the inward motion to deliver
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and JAMES GURNEY.
O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!
What brings you here to court so hastily?

 My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?

                 Philip! sparrow: James,
There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
[Exit Gurney.
Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
Could he get me?   Sir Robert could not do it:
We know   his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.

 Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.
But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;
I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;
Legitimation, name and all is gone:
Then, good my mother, let me know my father:
Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?

 As faithfully as I deny the devil.

  Now, by this light, were I to get again,
Madam, I would not wish a better father.
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
Subjected tribute to commanding love,
Against whose fury and unmatched force
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
 And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:
 Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.
[Exeunt. Hear the crier.

 One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
An a' may catch your hide and you alone:
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard:
I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;
Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.

 It lies as sightly on the back of him
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:
But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.

 Bastards, and else.

 Some bastards too.

 Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since
Sits on his horse back at mine hostess' door,
Teach us some fence!   [To Aust.] Sirrah, were I at home,
At your den, sirrah, with your lioness,
I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,
And make a monster of you.

 O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar.

 Speed then, to take advantage of the field.

 Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
In undetermined differences of kings.
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
Cry, 'havoc!' kings: back to the stained field,
You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
Then let confusion of one part confirm
The other's peace; till then, blows, blood and death!

 By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
And stand securely on their battlements,
As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
Your royal presences be ruled by me:
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
By east and west let France and England mount
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
Even till unfenced desolation
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
That done, dissever your united strengths,
And part your mingled colors once again;
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
Out of one side her happy minion,
To whom in favour she shall give the day,
And kiss him with a glorious victory.
How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
Smacks it not something of the policy?

 An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
Being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town,
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
Why then defy each other, and pell-mell
Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.

 O prudent discipline!   From north to south:
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:
I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!

 Here's a stay
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;
He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
But buffets better than a fist of France:
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.

 Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy
 Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
That, hang'd and drawn and quarter'd, there should be
In such a love so vile a lout as he.

 Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
Hath willingly departed with a part,
And France, whose armor conscience buckled on,
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
Who, having no external thing to lose
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,
That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
Commodity, the bias of the world,
The world, who of itself is peised well,
Made to run even upon even ground,
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
This sway of motion, this Commodity,
Makes it take head from all indifferency,
From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
And this same bias, this Commodity,
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
From a resolved and honorable war,
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
And why rail I on this Commodity?
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
When his fair angels would salute my palm;
But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
And say there is no sin but to be rich;
And being rich, my virtue then shall be
To say there is no vice but beggary.
Since kings break faith upon commodity,
Gain, by my lord, for I will worship thee.
[Exit. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.

 And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.

 And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.

 Your breeches best may carry them.

 Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.

 Will 't not be?
Will not a calf's-skin stop that mouth of thine?

 Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
Is it as he will? well, then, France shall rue.

 Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
Some airy devil hovers in the sky
And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,
While Philip breathes.
Enter KING JOHN, ARTHUR, and HUBERT.
             My lord, I rescued her;
Her highness is in safety, fear you not:
But on, my liege; for very little pains
Will bring this labor to a happy end.
[Exeunt. Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,
When gold and silver becks me to come on.
I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,
If ever I remember to be holy,
For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.

 But if you be afraid to hear the worst,
Then let the worst unheard fall on your head.

 How I have sped among the clergymen,
The sums I have collected shall express.
But as I travell'd hither through the land,
I find the people strangely fantasied;
Possess'd with rumors, full of idle dreams,
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
And here's a prophet, that I brought with me
>From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found

With many hundreds treading on his heels;
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
Your highness should deliver up your crown.

 The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
And others more, going to seek the grave
Of Arthur, whom they say is kill'd to-night
On your suggestion.

 I will seek them out.

 The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
[Exit. 
 Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
The king by me requests your presence straight.

 Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.

 But there is little reason in your grief;
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.

 'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.

 It is a damned and a bloody work;
The graceless action of a heavy hand,
If that it be the work of any hand.

 Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.

 Keep the peace, I say.

 Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:
If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.

 Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
Art thou damned, Hubert.

 Ha! I'll tell thee what;
Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.

 If thou didst but consent
To this most cruel act, do but despair;
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
That ever spider twisted from her womb
Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
Put but a little water in a spoon,
And it shall be as all the ocean,
Enough to stifle such a villain up.
I do suspect thee very grievously.

 Go, bear him in thine arms.
I am amazed, methinks, and lost my way
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
How easy dost thou take all England up!
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
The life, the right and truth of all this realm
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
Now powers from home and discontents at home
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.
                  [Exeunt. All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
But Dover castle: London hath received,
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:
Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
To offer service to your enemy,
And wild amazement hurries up and down
The little number of your doubtful friends.

 They found him dead and cast into the streets,
An empty casket, where the jewel of life
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.

 So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,
That borrow their behaviors from the great,
Grow great by your example and put on
The dauntless spirit of resolution.
Away, and glister like the god of war,
When he intendeth to become the field:
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
And fright him there? and make him tremble there ?
O, let it not be said: forage, and run
To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.

 O inglorious league!
Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
Send fair-play orders and make compromise,
Insinuation, parley and base truce
To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
Mocking the air with colors idly spread,
And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms:
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
Or if he do, let it at least be said
They saw we had a purpose of defence.

 Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,
Our party may well meet a prouder foe.
                   [Exeunt. According to the fair play of the world,
Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:
My holy lord of Milan, from the king
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;
And, as you answer, I do know the scope
And warrant limited unto my tongue.

 By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
He is prepared, and reason too he should:
This apish and unmannerly approach,
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
From out the circle of his territories.
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
To fierce and bloody inclination.

 No, I will speak.

 Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
And so shall you, being beaten: do but start
An echo with the clamor of thy drum,
And even at hand a drum is ready braced
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
Sound but another, and another shall
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,
Not trusting to this halting legate here,
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.

 And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
                              [Exeunt.  A friend. What art thou?

 Who thou wilt: and if thou please,
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
I come one way of the Plantagenets.

 Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad ?

 Brief, then; and what's the news?

 Show me the very wound of this ill news:
I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.

 How did he take it? who did taste to him ?

 Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty ?

 Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
And tempt us not to bear above our power!
I'll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.
Away before: conduct me to the king;
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
                 [Exeunt. O, I am scalded with my violent motion,
And spleen of speed to see your majesty!

 The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;
For in a night the best part of my power,
As I upon advantage did remove,
Were in the Washes all unwarily
Devoured by the unexpected flood.
             [The king dies.
 Art thou gone so?   I do but stay behind
To do the office for thee of revenge,
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,
And instantly return with me again,
To push destruction and perpetual shame
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.

 He will the rather do it when he sees
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.

 Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
With other princes that may best be spared,
Shall wait upon your father's funeral.

 Thither shall it then:
And happily may your sweet self put on
The lineal state and glory of the land!
To whom, with all submission, on my knee
I do bequeath my faithful services
And true subjection everlastingly.

 O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
This England never did, nor never shall,
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
But when it first did help to wound itself.
Now these her princes are come home again,
Come the three corners of the world in arms,
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
If England to itself do rest but true.
                    [Exeunt."
694,lew.,LEWIS,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-lew.," Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
Arthur, the great forerunner of thy blood,
Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
By this brave duke came early to his grave:
And for amends to his posterity.
At our importance hither is he come,
To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,
And to rebuke the usurpation
Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:
Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.

 A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?

 Women and fools, break off your conference.
King John, this is the very sum of all;
England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?

 I do, my lord; and in her eye I find
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye;
Which, being but the shadow of your son,
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:
I do protest I never loved myself
'Till now infixed I beheld myself
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
[Whispers with Blanch.
 Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;
For I do love her most unfeignedly.

 She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.

 Bethink you, father; for the difference
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,
Or the light loss of England for a friend:
Forego the easier.

 Father, to arms!

 I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,
When such profound respects do pull you on.

 What he hath won, that hath he fortified:
So hot a speed with such advice disposed,
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
Doth want example: who hath read or heard
Of any kindred action like to this?

 There's nothing in this world can make me joy:
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste,
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.

 All days of glory, joy and happiness.

 As heartily as he is glad he hath him.

 But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?

 And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.

 May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.

 Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:
If you say ay, the king will not say no.
[Exeunt. My lord Melun, let this be copied out,
And keep it safe for our remembrance:
Return the precedent to these lords again;
That, having our fair order written down,
Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,
May know wherefore we took the sacrament
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.

 A noble temper dost thou show in this;
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
Between compulsion and a brave respect!
Let me wipe off this honorable dew,
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
Being an ordinary inundation;
But this effusion of such manly drops,
This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.
Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
And with a great heart heave away the storm:
Commend these waters to those baby eyes
That never saw the giant world enraged;
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
Into the purse of rich prosperity
As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
And even there, methinks, an angel spake:
Enter PANDULPH.
Look, where the holy legate comes apace,
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven,
And on our actions set the name of right
With holy breath.

 Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
I am too high-born to be propertied,
To be a secondary at control,
Or useful serving-man and instrument,
To any sovereign state throughout the world.
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
Between this chastised kingdom and myself,
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
You taught me how to know the face of right,
Acquainted me with interest to this land,
Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;
And come ye now to tell me John hath made
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
I, by the honor of my marriage-bed,
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
What men provided, what munition sent,
To underprop this action? Is't not I
That undergo this charge? who else but I,
And such as to my claim are liable,
Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
Have I not heard these islanders shout out
'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?
Have I not here the best cards for the game,
To win this easy match play'd for a crown?
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.

 Outside or inside, I will not return
Till my attempt so much be glorified
As to my ample hope was promised
Before I drew this gallant head of war,
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,
To outlook conquest and to win renown
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
               [Trumpet sounds.
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
Enter the BASTARD, attended.
 There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler.

 We will attend to neither.
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
Plead for our interest and our being here.

 Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.

 The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
When English measure backward their own ground
In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
When with a volley of our needless shot,
After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
And wound our tattering colors clearly up,
Last in the field, and almost lords of it!
Enter a Messenger.
 Here: what news?

 Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
I did not think to be so sad to-night
As this hath made me. Who was he that said
King John did fly an hour or two before
The stumbling night did part our weary powers ?

 Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:
The day shall not be up so soon as I,
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.
                      [Exeunt."
695,aust.,LYMOGES,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-aust.," Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
As seal to this indenture of my love.
That to my home I will no more return,
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
And coops from other lands her islanders,
Even till that England, hedged in with the main,
That water-walled bulwark, still secure
And confident from foreign purposes,
Even till the utmost corner of the west
Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.

 The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
In such a just and charitable war.

 By how much unexpected, by so much
We must awake endeavour for defence;
For courage mounteth with occasion:
Let them be welcome then; we are prepared.
Enter KING JOHN, ELINOR, BLANCH, the Bastard,
Lords, and forces. 
 Peace!

 What the devil art thou?

 What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
With this abundance of superfluous breath?

 Peace! no more.

 I from the north.

 And your lips too; for I am well assured
That I did so when I was first assured.

 Lady Constance, peace!

 O, that a man should speak those words to me!

 Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.

 King Philip, listen to the cardinal.

 Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
Because--

 Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.

 Rebellion, flat rebellion!

"
696,pand.,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-pand.," Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
Do in his name religiously demand
Why thou against the church, our holy mother,
So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop
Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
This, in our aforesaid holy father's name,
Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.

 Then, by the lawful power that I have,
Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate:
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
From his allegiance to an heretic;
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
Canonized and worshipp'd as a saint,
That takes away by any secret course
Thy hateful life.

 There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.

 Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;
And raise the power of France upon his head,
Unless he do submit himself to Rome.

 What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?

 All form is formless, order orderless,
Save what is opposite to England's love.
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.

 So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,
That is, to be the champion of our church!
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
And may not be performed by thyself,
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Is not amiss when it is truly done,
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
The truth is then most done not doing it:
The better act of purposes mistook
Is to mistake again; though indirect,
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
It is a religion that doth make vows kept;
But thou hast sworn against religion,
But what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions:
Upon which better part our prayers come in,
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
The peril of our course light on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
But in despair die under their black weight.

 I will denounce a curse upon his head.

 Courage and comfort all shall yet go well.

 Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.

 You hold too heinous a respect of grief.

 Before the curing of a strong disease,
Even in the instant of repair and health,
The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,
On their departure most of all show evil:
What have you lost by losing of this day?

 If you had won it, certainly you had.
No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
She looks upon them with a threatening eye.
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
In this which he accounts so clearly won:
Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?

 Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
For even the breath of what I mean to speak
Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
Out of the path which shall directly lead
Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be
That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
The misplaced John should entertain an hour
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;
And he that stands upon a slippery place
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;
So be it, for it cannot be but so.

 You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.

 How green you are and fresh in this old world!
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
That none so small advantage shall step forth
To check his reign, but they will cherish it;
No natural exhalation in the sky,
No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,
No common wind, no customed event,
But they will pluck away his natural cause
And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,
Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.

 O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
If that young Arthur be not gone already,
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
Of all his people shall revolt from him
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
And, O, what better matter breeds for you
Than I have named!  The bastard Faulconbridge
Is now in England, ransacking the church,
Offending charity: if but a dozen French
Were there in arms, they would be as a call
To train ten thousand English to their s'de,
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful
What may be wrought out of their discontent,
Now that their souls are topfull of offence.
For England go: I will whet on the king.

 Take again
>From this my hand, as holding of the pope

Your sovereign greatness and authority.

 It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
But since you are a gentle convertite,
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
And make fair weather in your blustering land.
On this Ascension-day, remember well,
Upon your oath of service to the pope,
Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
                           [Exit.
 Hail, noble prince of France!
The next is this, King John hath reconciled
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,
That so stood out against the holy church,
The great metropolis and see of Rome:
Therefore thy threatening colors now wind up;
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
That, like a lion foster'd up at hand,
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
And be no further harmful than in show.

 You look but on the outside of this work.

 The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
And will not temporize with my entreaties;
He flatly says he 'll not lay down his arms.

 Give me leave to speak.

"
697,mel.,MELUN,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-mel.," Lead me to the revolts of England here.

 Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
And welcome home again discarded faith.
Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
For if the French be lords of this loud day,
He means to recompense the pains you take
By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn
And I with him, and many moe with me,
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love.

 Have I not hideous death within my view,
Retaining but a quantity of life,
Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
What in the world should make me now deceive,
Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
Why should I then be false, since it is true
That I must die here and live hence by truth?
I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours
Behold another day break in the east:
But even this night, whose black contagious breath
Already smokes about the burning crest
Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,
Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
Paying the fine of rated treachery
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
Commend me to one Hubert with your king:
The love of him, and this respect besides,
For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
>From forth the noise and rumor of the field,

Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
In peace, and part this body and my soul
With contemplation and devout desires.

"
698,chat.,CHATILLON,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-chat.," Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
In my behaviour to the majesty,
The borrow'd majesty, of England here.

 Philip of France, in right and true behalf
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son.
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
To this fair island and the territories,
To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
Which sways usurpingly these several titles.
And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.

 The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
To enforce the rights so forcibly withheld.

 Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
The farthest limit of my embassy.

 Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
And stir them up against a mightier task.
England, impatient of your just demands,
Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time
To land his legions all as soon as I;
His marches are expedient to this town,
His forces strong, h:s soldiers confident.
With him along is come the mother-queen,
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;
With them a bastard of the king's deceased;
And all the unsettled humors of the land,
Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
To make a hazard of new fortunes here:
In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
Did never float upon the swelling tide,
To do offence and scath in Christendom.
[Drum beats.
The interruption of their churlish drums
Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,

To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.

"
699,eli.,QUEEN ELINOR,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-eli.," A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'

 What now, my son! have I not ever said
How that ambitious Constance would not cease
Till she had kindled France and all the world,
Upon the right and party of her son?
This might have been prevented and made whole
With very easy arguments of love,
Which now   the manage of two kingdoms must
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.

 Your strong possession much more than your right,
Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.
Enter a Sheriff.
Essex. My liege, here is the strangest controversy
Come from the country to be judged by you
That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?

 Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
And wound her honor with this diffidence.

 He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
Do you not read some tokens of my son
In the large composition of this man?

 Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?

 I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
I am a soldier and now bound to France.

 Nay, I would have you go before me thither.

 The very spirit of Plantagenet!
I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.

 Who is it thou dost call usurper; France?

 Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,
That thou mayst be a queen, and check the world!

 There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.

 Come to thy grandam, child.

 His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.

 Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!

 Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
A will that bars the title of thy son.

 Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
Give with our niece a dowry large enough:
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
The bloom   that promiseth a mighty fruit.
I see a yielding in the looks of France;
Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls
Are capable of this ambition,
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
Cool and congeal again to what it was.

 Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.

 O foul revolt of French inconstancy!

 Farewell, gentle cousin.

 Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.

 My blessing go with thee!

"
700,const.,CONSTANCE,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-const.," O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
To make a more requital to your love!

 Stay for an answer to your embassy,
Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
That right in peace which here we urge in war,
And then we shall repent each drop of blood
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
Enter CHATILLON.
 Let me make answer; thy usurping son.

 My bed was ever to thy son as true
As thine was to thy husband; and this boy
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
Than thou and John in manners; being as like
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.
My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think
His father never was so true begot:
It cannot be, as if thou wert his mother.

 There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.

 Do, child, go to it grandam, child;
Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:
There's a good grandam.

 Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!
His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
To do him justice and revenge on you.

 Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!
Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp
The dominations, royalties and rights
Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,
Infortunate in nothing but in thee:
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;
The canon of the law is laid on him.
Being but the second generation
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.

 I have but this to say,
That he is not only plagued for her sin,
But God hath made her sin and her the plague
On this removed issue, plagued for her
And with her plague; her sin his injury,
Her injury the beadle to her sin,
All punish'd in the person of this child,
And all for her; a plague upon her!

 Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will;
A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!

 Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!
Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?
It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard;
Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:
It cannot be thou dost but say 'tis so:
I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word
Is but the vain breath of a common man:
Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;
I have a king's oath to the contrary.
Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
For I am sick and capable of fears,
Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,
A woman, naturally born to fears;
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,
But they will quake and tremble all this day.
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
Then speak again; not all thy former tale,
But this one word, whether thy tale be true.

 O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,
And let belief and life encounter so
As doth the fury of two desperate men
Which in the very meeting fall and die.
Lewis marry Blanch!   O boy, then where art thou?
France friend with England, what becomes of me?
Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.

 Which harm within itself so heinous is
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.

 If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
I would not care, I then would be content,
For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou
Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;
She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,
And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
And leave those woes alone which I alone
Am bound to under-bear.

 Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
To me and to the state of my great grief
Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
That no supporter but the huge firm earth
Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;
Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.
Seats herself on the ground.
Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILIP, LEWIS,   BLANCH, ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA,   and Attendants. 
 A wicked day, and not a holy day!
[Rising.
What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,
That it in golden letters should be set
Among the high tides in the calendar?
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
This day of shame, oppression, perjury.
Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child
Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
No bargains break that are not this day made:
This day, all things begun come to ill end,
Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!

 You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,
Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
Is cold in amity and painted peace,
And our oppression hath made up this league.
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!
A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,
Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings
Hear me, O, hear me!

 War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war.
O Lymoges!   O Austria! thou dost shame
That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
Thou little valiant, great in villany!
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,
And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
Upon my party!   Thou cold-blooded slave,
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.

 O, lawful let it be
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
Good father cardinal, cry thou amen
To my keen curses: for without my wrong
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.

 And for mine too: when law can do no right,
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?

 Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,
And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.

 What should he say, but as the cardinal?

 O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.

 O, if thou grant my need,
Which only lives but by the death of faith,
That need must needs infer this principle,
That faith would live again by death of need.
O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!

 O, be removed from him, and answer well!

 O, upon my knee
Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
Forethought by heaven!

 That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
His honor: O, thine honor, Lewis, thine honor!

 O fair return of banish'd majesty!

 Lo, now! now see the issue of your peace.

 No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
But that which ends all counsel, true redress,
Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
Thou odoriferous stench! sound rottenness!
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
And I will kiss thy detestable bones
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
And ring these fingers with thy household worms
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
And be a carrion monster like thyself:
Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,
O, come to me!

 No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
Then with a passion I would shake the world;
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,
Which scorns a modern invocation.

 Thou art not holy to belie me so;
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:
O, if I could, what grief I should forget
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;
For being not mad but sensible of grief,
My reasonable part produces reason
How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
And teaches me to kill or hang myself:
If I were mad, I should forget my son,
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:
I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
The different plague of each calamity.

 To England, if you will.

 Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
'O that these hands could so redeem my son,
As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
But now I envy at their liberty,
And will again commit them to their bonds,
Because my poor child is a prisoner.
And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:
If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
To him that did but yesterday suspire,
There was not such a gracious creature born.
But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
And chase the native beauty from his cheek
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,
And so he 'l die; and, rising so again,
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
I shall not know him: therefore, never, never,
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.

 He talks to me that never had a son.

 Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?
Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,
I could give better comfort than you do.
I will not keep this form upon my head,
When there is such disorder in my wit.
O Lord I my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
My life, my joy, my food, my all the world
My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' curel

That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,

Or if you will, to speak more properly,
I will enforce it easily to my love.
Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
That all I see in you is worthy love,
Than this; that nothing do I see in you,
Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,

What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,

O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new
Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,
Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,
Upon my knees I beg, go not to arms
Against mine uncle.

 Now shall I see thy love: what motive may
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?

 The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!
Which is the side that I must go withal?
I am with both: each army hath a hand;
And in their rage, I having hold of both,
They whirl asunder and dismember me.
Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;
Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;
Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive:

From France to England, there to live in peace.
England we love; and for that England's sake
With burden of our armour here we sweat.

But thou from loving England art so far,
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king,

For this down-trodden equity, we tread
In warlike march these greens before your town,
Being no further enemy to you
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
In the relief of this oppressed child
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
To pay that duty which you truly owe
To him that owes it, namely this young prince:
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;
Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,
We will bear home that lusty blood again
Which here we came to spout against your town,
And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,
'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls
Can hide you from our messengers of war,
Though all these English and their discipline
Were harbor'd in their rude circumference.
Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
In that behalf which we have challenged it?
Or shall we give the signal to our rage
And stalk in blood to our possession?

 As many and as well-born bloods as those,--

 Stand in his face to contradict his claim.

 Amen, amen   Mount, chevaliers! to arms!

 It shall be so; and at the other hill
Command the rest to stand. God and our right!   Exeunt. 
Here after excursions, enter the Herald of France, with trumpets, to the gates.
 England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood.
In this hot trial, more than we of France;
Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
That sways the earth this climate overlooks,
Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,
We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,
Or add a royal number to the dead,
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.

 Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?

 Know him in us, that here hold up his right.

 Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?

 Our thunder from the south
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.

 What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.

 It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.

 Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
Let in that amity which you have made;
For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
I know she is not, for this match made up
Her presence would have interrupted much:
Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.

 And, by my faith, this league that we have made
Will give her sadness very little cure.
Brother of England, how may we content
This widow lady?   In her right we came;
Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,
To our own vantage.

 'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day
Ever in France shall be kept festival:
To solemnize this day the glorious sun
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
Turning with splendour of his precious eye
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:
The yearly course that brings this day about
Shall never see it but a holiday.

 By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
To curse the fair proceedings of this day:
Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?

 Here comes the holy legate of the pope.

 Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.

 I am perplexed, and know not what to say.

 Good reverend father, make my person yours,
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
And the conjunction of our inward souls
Married in league, coupled and link'd together
With all religious strength of sacred vows;
The latest breath that gave the sound of words
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,
And even before this truce, but new before,
No longer than we well could wash our hands
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and overstain'd
With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
The fearful difference of incensed kings:
And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regret?
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriagebed
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
And make a riot on the gentle brow
Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
My reverend father, let it not be so!
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
To do your pleasure and continue friends.

 I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.

 Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.

 Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire:
Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.

 So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
A whole armado of convicted sail
Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.

 What can go well, when we have run so ill?
Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain ?
And bloody England into England gone,
O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?

 Well could I bear that England had this praise,
So we could find some pattern of our shame.
Enter CONSTANCE.
Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;
Holding the eternal spirit, against her will,
In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
I prithee, lady, go away with me.

 Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!

 O fair affliction, peace!

 Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
Sticking toether in calamity.

 Bind up your hairs.

 You are as fond of grief as of your child.

 I fear some outrage, and I 'll follow her.

"
705,fir.-cit.,FIRST CITIZEN,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-fir.-cit.," Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?

 In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:
For him, and in his right, we hold this town.

 That can we not; but he that proves the king,
To him will we prove loyal: till that time
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.

 Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
We for the worthiest hold the right from both.

 Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,
From first to last, the onset and retire
Of both your armies; whose equality
By our best eyes cannot be censured:
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answer'd blows;
Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:
Both are alike; and both alike we like.
One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,
We hold our town for neither, yet for both.
Re-enter the two KINGS, with their powers,severally. 
 The king of England, when we know the king.

 A greater power than we denies all this;
And till it be undoubted, we do lock
Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;
King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,
Be by some certain king purged and deposed.

 Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;
Win you this city without stroke or wound;
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
That here come sacrifices for the field:
Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.

 That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
Is niece to England: look upon the years
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
Is the young Dauphin every way complete:
If not complete of, say he is not she;
And she again wants nothing, to name want,
If want it be not that she is not he:
He is the half part of a blessed man,
Left to be finished by such as she;
And she a fair divided excellence,
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
O, two such silver currents, when they join,
Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
And two such shores to two such streams made one,
Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
To these two princes, if you marry them.
This union shall do more than battery can
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
And give you entrance: but without this match,
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
More free from motion, no, not Death himself
In mortal fury half so peremptory,
As we to keep this city.

 Why answer not the double majesties
This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?
K. Phi. Speak England first, that hath been forward first
To speak unto this city: what say you?

Much work for tears in many an English mother,

Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;

There stuck no plume in any English crest
That is removed by a staff of France;

   I see I cannot get thy father's love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

 Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object I am too great of birth;
And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
My riots past, my wild societies;
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.

 No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.

 Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

 Sir, will you hear me?

 Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all checks, rebukes and manners,
I must advance the colours of my love
And not retire: let me have your good will.

 Farewell, gentle mistress; farewell, Nan.
[Exeunt Mrs. Page and Anne. 
 I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.

 Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.

 From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at;
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
That neither singly can be manifested,
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry: she hath consented:
Now, sir,
Her mother, ever strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white,
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
The better to denote her to the doctor,
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head:
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
The maid hath given consent to go with him.

 Both, my good host, to go along with me:
And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
And, in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.

 So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
Besides, I'll make a present recompense.
[Exeunt.
 You do amaze: hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
The offence is holy that she hath committed;
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.

   He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor.
Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.

 With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:
O, odious is the name!

 The horn, I say. Farewell.
Take heed, have open eyes, for thieves do foot by night:
Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.

Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearts unswept,

Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants.
        Within a quarter of an hour.

 There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.

 That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song: upon their sight,
We two in great amazedness will fly:
Then let them all encircle him about
And, fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight,
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.

 The truth being known,
We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
And mock him home to Windsor.

 My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
Finely attired in a robe of white.

 Fear not you that. Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies.

 Go, Mistress Ford,
Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
[Exit Mrs. Ford.
I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will.
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
And he my husband best of all affects.
The doctor is well money'd and his friends
Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.
[Exit. 
     Against such lewdsters and their lechery
Those that betray them do no treachery.

 Alas, what noise?

 I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town?

  A puffed man?

    Why went you not with master doctor, maid?

 Well, I will must no further, Master Fenton,
Heaven give you many, many merry days!
Good husband, let us every one go home,
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;

[Exit.
  Blessing of his heart!

    And that's a good root.

   From the two parties, forsooth.

    Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,
You moonshine revellers, and shades of night,
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.

 About, about;
Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower:
Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue, and white;
Like sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.

 With trial-fire touch me his fingerend:
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

 Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.

SONG.

Fie on sinful fantasy!
Fie on lust and luxury!
Lust is but a bloody fire,
Kindled with unchaste desire.
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
Pinch him for his villany;
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.

During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS comes one way, and steals away a boy in green; SLENDER another
way, and takes off a boy in white; and
FENTON comes, and steals away MRS
ANNE PAGE. A noise of hunting is
heard within. All the Fairies run away.
FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head, and rises.

735,the.,THESEUS,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-the.," Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; for happy days bring in
Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame or a dowager
Long withering out a young man's revenue.

 Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
                     [Exit Philostrate.
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
   Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS.
 Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?

 What say you, Hermia? be advised, fair maid:
To you your father should be as a god;
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

 In himself he is;
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
The other must be held the worthier.

 Rather your eyes must with his judgement look.

 Either to die the death or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

 Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon--
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
For everlasting bond of fellowship--
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.

 I must confess that I have heard so much,
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
But, being over-full of self-affairs,
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
I have some private schooling for you both.
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
To fit your fancies to your father's will;
Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
Which by no means we may extenuate--
To death, or to a vow of single life.
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

 Go, one of you, find out the forester;
For now our observation is perform'd;
And since we have the vaward of the day,
My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
                          [Exit an Attendant.
We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
And mark the musical confusion
Of hounds and echo in conjunction.

 My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
Each under each. A cry more tuneable
Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?

 No doubt they rose up early to observe
The rite of May, and, hearing our intent,
Came here in grace of our solemnity.
But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
That Hermia should give answer of her choice?

 Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
[Horns and shouts within. Lys., Dem., Hel., and Her., wake and start up. 
Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?

 I pray you all, stand up.
I know you two are rival enemies:
How comes this gentle concord in the world,
That hatred is so far from jealousy,
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?

 Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
Egeus, I will overbear your will;
For in the temple, by and by, with us
These couples shall eternally be knit:
And, for the morning now is something worn,
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
Away with us to Athens; three and three,
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
Come, Hippolyta.
[Exeunt The., Hip., Ege., and train.
 More strange than true: I never may believe
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover and the poet
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination,
That, if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy:
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!

 Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA.
Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
Accompany your hearts!

 Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
To wear away this long age of three hours
Between our after-supper and bed-time?
Where is our usual manager of mirth?
What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
Call Philostrate.

 Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
The lazy time, if not with some delight?

 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
 [Reads]'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
That is an old device; and it was play'd
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
Reads'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
That is some satire, keen and critical,
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
Reads'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?

 What are they that do play it?

 And we will hear it.

 I will hear that play;
For never anything can be amiss,
When simpleness and duty tender it.
Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.
                            [Exit Philostrate. 
 Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.

 The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
Takes it in might, not merit.
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Throttle their practised accent in their fears
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
And in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
In least speak most, to my capacity.

 Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander: and, my gracious duke,
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
And stolen the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
Be it so she will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.

 Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
And what is mine my love shall render him.
And she is mine, and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.

 With duty and desire we follow you.
[Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia.
 My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
And this Lysander; this Demetrius is;
This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
I wonder of their being here together.

 It is, my lord.

 Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
Thereby to have defeated you and me,
You of your wife and me of my consent,
Of my consent that she should be your wife.

"
737,lys.,LYSANDER,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-lys.," You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.

 I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

 How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?

 Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth;
But, either it was different in blood,--

 Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--

 Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--

 Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Making it momentany as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
So quick bright things come to confusion.

 A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
And she respects me as her only son,
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town,
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
To do observance to a morn of May,
There will I stay for thee.

 Keep promise, love.   Look, here comes Helena.
   Enter HELENA.
 Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
Through Athens' gates we have devised to steal.

 I will, my Hermia.
                            [Exit Herm.
Helena, adieu:
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
                            [Exit.
 Fair love, you faint with wandering is the wood;
And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
And tarry for the comfort of the day.

 One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.

 O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
So that but one heart we can make of it;
Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
So then two bosoms and a single troth.
Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.

 Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
And then end life when I end loyalty!
Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!

 And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!

 Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things growing are not ripe until their season:
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
And touching now the point of human skill,
Reason becomes the marshal to my will
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
Love's stories written in love's richest book.

 She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
Or as the heresies that men do leave
Are hated most of those they did deceive,
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
Of all be hated, but the most of me!
And, all my powers, address your love and might
To honor Helen and to be her knight! [Exit. Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision never come in tears:
Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
In their nativity all truth appears.
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?

 I had no judgement when to her I swore.

 Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.

 You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
Whom I do love and will do till my death.

 Helen, it is not so.

 Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?

 Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?

 Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!

 Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
To prove him false that says I love thee not.

 If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.

 Away, you Ethiope!

 Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!

 Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!

 Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.

 What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.

 Ay, by my life;
And never did desire to see thee more.
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.

 Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.

 Get you gone, you dwarf;
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
You bead, you acorn.

 Now she holds me not;
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.

 Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.

 I will be with thee straight.

 He goes before me and still dares me on:
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
And here will rest me. [Lies down.]Come, thou gentle day!
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
                                 [Sleeps.
Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS. 
 Pardon, my lord.

 My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
I cannot truly say how I came here;
But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
And now I do bethink me, so it is,--
I came with Hermia hither: our intent
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
Without the peril of the Athenian law.

 And he did bid us follow to the temple.

 More than to us
Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!

  This lion is a very fox for his valor.

 Proceed, Moon.

 And so the lion vanished.

  She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.

"
738,dem.,DEMETRIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-dem.," Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield,
Thy crazed title to my certain right.

 I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
And here am I, and wode within this wood,
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.

 Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?

 Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
For I am sick when I do look on thee.

 You do impeach your modesty too much,
To leave the city and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night
And the ill counsel of a desert place
With the rich worth of your virginity.

 I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.

 I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.

 I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.

 Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
                             [Exit.
 O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.

 So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.

 I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

 You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.

 An if I could, what should I get therefore?

 There is no following her in this fierce vein:
Here therefore for a while I will remain.
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
If for his tender here I make some stay.
             [Lies down and sleeps.
 O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eye?
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!

 Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
And now to Helen is it home return'd,
There to remain.

 Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
   Re-enter HERMIA.
 If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

 I say I love thee more than he can do.

 Quick, come!

 No, no; he'll...
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!

 I would I had your bond, for I perceive
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.

 No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

 You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.

 Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
[Exeunt Lysander and Demetrius.
 Lysander! speak again:
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?

 Yea, art thou there?

 Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
Where art thou now?

 Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
If ever I thy face by daylight see:
Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
To measure out my length on this cold bed.
By day's approach look to be visited.
                           [Lies down and sleeps.
  Re-enter HELENA.
 My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
And I in fury hither follow'd them,
Fair Helena in fancy following me.
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow, seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.

 These things seem small and undistinguishable,
Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.

 Are you sure
That we are awake?   It seems to me
That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
The duke was here, and bid us follow him ?

 Why, then, we are awake; let's follow him;
And by the way let us recount our dreams.
                                [Exeunt.

 A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
Which is as brief as I have known a play;
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
The passion of loud laughter never shed.

 Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
Which never labor'd in their minds till now,
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
With this same play, against your nuptial.

 No, my noble lord;
It is not for you: I have heard it over,
And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
Unless you can find sport in their intents,
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,

Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.

 I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
Such gallant chiding; for, besides the groves,
The skies, the fountains, every region near
Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.

 'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.

 But all the story of the night told over,
And all their minds transfigured so together,
More witnesseth than fancy's images
And grows to something of great constancy;
But, howsoever, strange and admirable.


 I love not to see wretchedness o'ercharged
And duty in his service perishing.

 He says they can do nothing in this kind.

  This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.

    Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.

  "
747,her.,HERMIA,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-her.," So is Lysander.

 I would my father look'd but with my eyes.

 I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty,
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

 So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

 Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

 O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.

 O spite! too old to be engaged to young.

 O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.

 If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross,
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.

 My good Lysander!
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.

 God speed, fair Helena! whither away?

 I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

 I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

 The more I hate, the more he follows me.

 His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

 Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see,
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!

 And in the wood, where often you and I
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Farewell, sweet playfellow; pray thou for us;
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
Keep word, Lysander; we must starve our sight
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.

 Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
For I upon this bank will rest my head.

 Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.

 Lysander riddles very prettily:
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off; in human modesty,
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!

 With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
                          [They sleep. 
Enter PUCK.
 Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.
Lysander! what, removed?   Lysander! lord!
What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
Alack, where are you? speak, an if you hear;
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
No? then I well perceive you are not nigh:
Either death or you I'll find immediately.
                                     [Exit
 Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
And kill me too.
The sun was not so true unto the day
As he to me: would he have stolen away
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
May through the centre creep and so displease
Her brother's noontide with the Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.

 What's this to my Lysander? where is he
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

 Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
Of maiden's patience.   Hast thou slain him, then?
Henceforth be never number'd among men!
O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.

 I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.

 A privilege never to see me more.
And from thy hated presence part I so:
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
                                 [Exit.
 Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
It pays the hearing double recompense.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

 What love could press Lysander from my side?

 You speak not as you think; it cannot be.

 I am amazed at your passionate words.
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.

 I understand not what you mean by this.

 Sweet, do not scorn her so.

 Lysander, whereto tends all this?

 Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
Sweet love,--

 Do you not jest?

 What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left me:
Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
In earnest, shall I say?

 O me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!
You thief of love! what, have you come by night
And stolen my love's heart from him?

 Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
And with her personage, her tall personage,
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
And are you grown so high in his esteem;
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
How low am I, thou painted Maypole? speak;
How low am I? I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

 Lower! hark, again.

 Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?

 What, with Lysander?

 'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her.

 You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
Nay, go not back.

 I am amazed, and know not what to say.
                         [Exit. 
 Never so weary, never so in woe,
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
I can no further crawl, no further go;
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
                      [Lies down and sleeps.
 Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
When every thing seems double.

 Yea; and my father.

"
748,hel.,HELENA,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-hel.," Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching: O, were favor so,
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.

 O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!

 O that my prayers could such affection move!

 The more I love, the more he hateth me.

 None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!

 How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities:
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured every where:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.
                                    [Exit. You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
And I shall have no power to follow you.

 And even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
What worser place can I beg in your love,--
And yet a place of high respect with me,--
Than to be used as you use your dog?

 And I am sick when I look not on you.

 Your virtue is my privilege; for that
It is not night when I do see your face,
Therefore I think I am not in the night;
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
For you in my respect are all the world:
Then how can it be said I am alone,
When all the world is here to look on me?

 The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
When cowardice pursues and valor flies.

 Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
We should be woo'd and were not made to woo.
                     [Exit Dem. 
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well.
                     [Exit.
 Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.

 O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.

 O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
For she hath blesssed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright?   Not with salt tears:
If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.

 Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.

 Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
That I did never, no, nor never can,
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
But you must flout my insufficiency?
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
In such disdainful manner me to woo.
But fare you well: perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
O, that a lady, of one man refused,
Should of another therefore be abused!
                            [Exit.
 You do advance your cunning more and more.
When truth kills truth, O devilish holy fray!
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.

 Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.

 O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
To set against me for your merriment:
If you were civil and knew courtesy,
You would not do me thus much injury.
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
But you must join in souls to mock me too?
If you were men, as men you are in show,
You would not use a gentle lady so;
To vow and swear and superpraise my parts,
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
With your derision! none of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin, and extort
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.

 Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

 Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
Have with our needles created both one flower,
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
Had been incorporate. So we grew together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
But yet an union in partition;
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury.

 Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius,
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
Precious, celestial?   Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
What though I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
But miserable most, to love unloved?
This you should pity rather than despise.

 Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
You would not make me such an argument.
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.

 O excellent!

 Yes, sooth; and so do you.

 Fine, i'faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!

 I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
I am a right maid for my cowardice:
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
Because she is something lower than myself,
That I can match her.

 Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
I evermore did love you, Hermia,
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back
And follow you no further: let me go:
You see how simple and how fond I am.

 A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.

 With Demetrius.

 O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
She was a vixen when she went to school;
And though she be but little, she is fierce.

 I will not trust you, I,
Nor longer stay in your curst company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
My legs are longer though, to run away.[Exit.

 O weary night, O long and tedious night,
Abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east,
That I may back to Athens by daylight,
From these that my poor company detest:
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
Steal me awhile from mine own company.
                     [Lies down and sleeps.
 So methinks:
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
Mine own, and not mine own.
 And Hippolyta.

"
749,obe.,OBERON,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-obe.," Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.

 Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?

 How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
With Ariadne and Antiopa?

 Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
I do but beg a little changeling boy,
To be my henchman.

 How long within this wood intend you stay?

 Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.

 Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
Till I torment thee for this injury.
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou remembrest
Since once I sat upon a promontory,
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
To hear the sea-maid's music.

 That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal throned by the west,
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
And the imperial votaress passed on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower,
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.

 Having once this juice,
I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
The next thing then she waking looks upon,
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
As I can take it with another herb,
I'll make her render up her page to me.
But who comes here? I am invisible;
And I will overhear their conference.
Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA following him.
 Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
   Re-enter PUCK.
Hast thou the flower there?   Welcome, wanderer.

 I pray thee, give it me.
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
And make her full of hateful fantasies.
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care, that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.

    What thou seest when thou dost wake,
   Do it for thy true-love take,
   Love and languish for his sake:
   Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
   Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
   In thy eye that shall appear
   When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
   Wake when some vile thing is near.
                      [Exit.
 Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA. 
 I wonder if Titania be awaked;
Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
Which she must dote on in extremity.
  Enter PUCK.
Here comes my messenger.
How now, mad spirit!
What night-rule now about this haunted grove ?

 This falls out better than I could devise.
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?

 Stand close: this is the same Athenian.

 What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.

 About the wood go swifter than the wind,
And Helena of Athens look thou find:
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
By some illusion see thou bring her here:
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.

      Flower of this purple dye,
     Hit with Cupid's archery,
     Sink in apple of his eye.
     When his love he doth espy,
     Let her shine as gloriously
     As the Venus of the sky.
     When thou wakest, if she be by,
     Beg of her for remedy.
  Re-enter PUCK.
      Stand aside; the noise they make
     Will cause Demetrius to awake.

 This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.

 Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
As one come not within another's way.
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
And from each other look thou lead them thus,
Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
To take from thence all error with his might,
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
When they next wake, all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
With league whose date till death shall never end.
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
And then I will her charmed eye release
From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.

 But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
We may effect this business yet ere day.
                                [Exit.
 Welcome, good Robin. See'st thou this sweet sight?
Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
Seeking sweet favors from this hateful fool,
I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
When I had at my pleasure taunted her
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
I then did ask of her her changeling child;
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
And now I have the boy, I will undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
From off the head of this Athenian swain;
That, he awaking when the other do,
May all to Athens back again repair
And think no more of this night's accidents
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
But first I will release the fairy queen.
     Be as thou wast wont to be;
     See as thou wast wont to see:
     Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
     Hath such force and blessed power.
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.

 There lies your love.

 Silence awhile. Robin, take off this I head.
Titania, music call; and strike more dead
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.

 Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
Now thou and I are new in amity,
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly
And bless it to all fair prosperity:
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.

 Then, my queen, in silence sad,
     Trip we after night's shade:
     We the globe can compass soon,
     Swifter than the wandering moon.

 Through the house give glimmering light,
By the dead and drowsy fire:
Every elf and fairy sprite
Hop as light as bird from brier;
And this ditty, after me,
Sing, and dance it trippingly.

 Now, until the break of day,
Through this house each fairy stray.
To the best bride-bed will we,
Which by us shall blessed be;
And the issue there create
Ever shall be fortunate.
So shall all the couples three
Ever true in loving be;
And the blots of Nature's hand
Shall not in their issue stand;
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
Nor mark prodigious, such as are
Despised in nativity,
Shall upon their children be.
With this field-dew consecrate,
Every fairy take his gait;
And each several chamber bless,
Through this palace, with sweet peace;
And the owner of it blest
Ever shall in safety rest.
Trip away; make no stay;
Meet me all by break of day.
[Exeunt Oberon, Titania, and train.
"
750,tita.,TITANIA,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-tita.," What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
I have forsworn his bed and company.

 Then I must be thy lady: but I know
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
Come from the farthest steppe of India?
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity.

 These are the forgeries of jealousy:
And never, since the middle summer's spring,
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
Or in the beached margent of the sea,
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
Have every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents:
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
The human mortals want their winter here;
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
That rheumatic diseases do abound:
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
The childing autumn, angry winter, change
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which:
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate, from our dissension;
We are their parents and original.

 Set your heart at rest:
The fairy land buys not the child of me.
His mother was a votaress of my order:
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
To fetch me trifles, and return again,
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
And for her sake I will not part with him.

 Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
If you will patiently dance in our round
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.

 Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
            [Exit Titania with her train.
 Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
Then to your offices and let me rest.
          The Fairies sing.
You spotted snakes with double tongue,
   Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
   Come not near our fairy queen.
   Philomel, with melody
   Sing in our sweet lullaby;
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
   Never harm,
   Nor spell nor charm,
 Come our lovely lady nigh;
 So, good night, with lullaby.
Weaving spiders, conme not here;
 Hence, kyou long-legg'd spinners, hence!
Beetles black, approach not near;
 Worm nor snail, do no offence.
   Philomel, with melody, &c.

 What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?

 I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.

 Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

 Out of this wood do not desire to go:
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of no common rate;
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep.
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED.
 Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
With purple grapes, green figs and mulberries;
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
To have my love to bed and to arise;
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.

 Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.
                                 [Exeunt.
 Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
And stick musk-roses in thy sleek, smooth head,
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.

 What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?

 Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.

 I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.

 Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.
                       [Exeunt fairies.
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
Gentle entwist; the female ivy so
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee.
                                [They sleep.
  Enter PUCK. My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.

 How came these things to pass?
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!

 Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
[Music, still. 
 Come, my lord, and in our flight
     Tell me how it came this night
     That I sleeping here was found
    With these mortals on the ground.
                                [Exeunt.
 [Horns winded within.
Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train.
 First, rehearse your song by rote,
To each word a warbling note:
Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
Will we sing, and bless this place.
                   [Song and dance.
"
751,puck.,PUCK,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-puck.," How now, spirit! whither wander you?

 The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling;
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But they do square, that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.

 Thou speak'st aright;
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab,
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.

 I remember.

 I'll put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes. [Exit.
 Ay, there it is.

 Fear not, my lord, you servant shall do so.
                              [Exeunt.  Through the forest have I gone,
But Athenian found I none,
On whose eyes I might approve
This flower's force in stirring love.
Night and silence.--Who is here?
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
This is he, my master said,
Despised the Athenian maid;
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
On the dank and dirty ground.
Pretty soul! she durst not lie
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
All the power this charm doth owe.
When thou wakest, let love forbid
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
So awake when I am gone;
For I must now to Oberon.
                            [Exit.
   Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running.
 What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.

 A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
                                [Exit. 
 I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
                                     [Exit.

 My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
When I did him at this advantage take,
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.

 I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
And the Athenian woman by his side:
That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
 Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS. 
 This is the woman, but not this the man.

 Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.

 I go, I go; look how I go,
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.

      Captain of our fairy band,
     Helena is here at hand;
     And the youth, mistook by me,
     Pleading for a lover's fee.
     Shall we their fond pageant see?
     Lord, what fools these mortals be!

      Then will two at once woo one;
     That must needs be sport alone;
     And those things do best please me
     That befall preposterously.
Enter Lysander and Helena.
 Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garment he had on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
And so far am I glad it so did sort
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.

 My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger:
At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
That in crossways and floods have burial,
Already to their wormy beds are gone;
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
They wilfully themselves exile from light
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.

 Up and down, up and down,
     I will lead them up and down:
     I am fear'd in field and town:
     Goblin, lead them up and down.
Here comes one.

 Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?

 Follow me, then,
To plainer ground.
[Exit Lysander, as following the voice.
             Re-enter DEMETRIUS.
 Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
I'll whip thee with a rod; he is defiled
That draws a sword on thee.

 Follow my voice; we'll try no manhood here.
                          [Exeunt. 
   Re-enter LYSANDER.
 Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?

 Come hither: I am here.

 Yet but three?   Come one more;
Two of both kinds makes up four.
Here she comes, curst and sad:
Cupid is a knavish lad,

Thus to make poor females mad.
  Re-enter HERMIA.
 On the ground
     Sleep sound:
     I'll apply
     To your eye,
     Gentle lover, remedy.
[Squeezing the juice on Lysander's eyes.
When thou wakest,
     Thou takest
     True delight
     In the sight
   Of thy former lady's eye:
   And the country proverb known,
   That every man should take his own,
   In your waking shall be shown:
     Jack shall have Jill;
     Nought shall go ill;
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

[Exit. 
 Now, when thou wakest, with thine own fool's eyes peep.

 Fairy king, attend, and mark:
     I do hear the morning lark.

 Now the hungry lion roars
And the wolf behowls the moon;
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
All with weary task fordone.
Now the wasted brands do glow,
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud.
Now it is the time of night
That the graves all gaping wide,
Every one lets forth his sprite,
In the church-way paths to glide:
And we fairies, that do run
By the triple Hecate's team,
From the presence of the sun,
Following darkness like a dream,
Now are frolic: not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
I am sent with broom before,
To sweep the dust behind the door.
Enter OBERON and TITANIA wlith their train.
 If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended,
That you have but slumber'd here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend:
If you pardon, we will mend:
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;
Else the Puck a liar call;
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.[Exit,

756,pro.,Prologue,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-pro.," If we offend, it is with our good will,
That you should think, we come not to offend,
But with good will. To show our simple skill,
That is the true beginning of our end.
Consider then we come but in despite.
We do not come as minding to content you,
Our true intent is. All for your delight
We are not here. That you should here repent you,
The actors are at hand and by their show
You shall know all that you are like to know.

 Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scare away, or rather did affright;
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
At large discourse, while here they do remain,
[Exeunt Prologue, Pyramus, Thisbe, Lion,and Moonshine.

That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
[Wall holds up his fingers. 
Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
But what see I?   No Thisby do I see.
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
Curst be thy stones for thus deceiving me!

  I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face.
Thisby!

 Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.

 Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.

 O, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!

 Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?

 Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now   so bright;
For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
I trust to take of true Thisby sight.
But stay, O spite!
But mark, poor knight,
What dreadful dole is here!
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?
O dainty duck! O dear!
Thy mantle good,
What, stain'd with blood!
Approach, ye Furies fell!
O Fates, come, come,
Cut thread and thrum;
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!

 O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
Which is-no, no--which was the fairest dame
That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd with cheer.
Come, tears, confound;
Out, sword, and wound
The pap of Pyramus;
Ay, that left pap,
Where heart doth hop:[Stabs himself. 
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Now am I dead,
Now am I fled;
My soul is in the sky:

Moon, take thy flight:[Exit Moonshine.

Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.

 My love thou art, my love I think.

 And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.

 As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.

 I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.

 'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.

 This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?

 Asleep, my love?
What, dead, my dove?
O Pyramus, arise!
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
Dead, dead? A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes.
These lily lips,
This cherry nose,
These yellow cowslip cheeks,
Are gone, are gone:
Lovers, make moan:
His eyes were green as leeks.
O Sisters Three,
Come, come to me,
With hands as pale as milk;
Lay them in gore,
Since you have shore
With shears his thread of silk.
Tongue, not a word:
Come, trusty sword;
Come, blade, my breast imbrue:

That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Did whisper often very secretly.
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.

I do not so secure me in the error,
But the main articles I do approve
In fearful sense.

 Now, what's the business?

 How say you by this change?

 Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

 'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?

 Write from us to him; post-posthaste dispatch.

 Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
Against the general enemy Ottoman.
[To Brabantio] I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

 Why, what's the matter?

 Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
And you of her, the bloody book of law
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
Stood in your action.

 [To Othello] What, in your own part, can you say to this?

 To vouch this, is no proof,
Without more wider and more overt test
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
First Sen. But, Othello, speak:
Did you by indirect and forced courses
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
Or came it by request and such fair question
As soul to soul affordeth?

 Fetch Desdemona hither.

 Say it, Othello.

 I think this tale would win my daughter too.
Good Brabantio,
Take up this mangled matter at the best:
Men do their broken weapons rather use
Than their bare hands.

 Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
Into your favor.
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
Patience her injury a mockery makes.
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

  If you please,
Be't at her father's.

 What would you, Desdemona?

 Be it as you shall privately determine,
Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
And speed must answer it.

 At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
Othello, leave some officer behind,
And he shall our commission bring to you;
With such things else of quality and respect
As doth import you.

 Let it be so.
Good night to every one. [To Bra.] And, noble signior,
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

"
765,bra.,BRABANTIO,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-bra.," What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there?

 Why, wherefore ask you this?

 What, have you lost your wits?

 Not I: what are you?

 The worser welcome:
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
To start my quiet.

 But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee.

 What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
My house is not a grange.

  Thou art a villain.

 This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

 Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper! call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream:
Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say! light!
[Exit above.
 It is too true an evil: gone she is;
And what's to come of my despised time
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
Where didst thou see her?   O unhappy girl!
With the Moor, say'st thou?   Who would be a father!
How didst thou know 'twas she?   O, she deceives me
Past thought!   What said she to you?   Get more tapers:
Raise all my kindred.   Are they married, think you?

 O heaven!   How got she out?   O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
By what you see them act. Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May he abused?   Have you not read, Roderigo,
Of some such thing?

 Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
Some one way, some another. Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

 Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
And raise some special officers of night.
On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.
[Exeunt.
 Down with him, thief!
[They draw on both sides.
 O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
If she in chains of magic were not bound,
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world, a practiser
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
Subdue him at his peril.

 To prison, till fit time
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer.

 How! the duke in council!
In this time of the night! Bring him away:
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
Or any of my brothers of the state,
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
For if such actions may have passage free,
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
[Exeunt. 
 So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
Take hold on me, for my particular grief
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
And it is still itself.

 My daughter! O, my daughter!

 Ay, to me;
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
For nature so preposterously to err,
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
Sans witchcraft could not.

 Humbly I thank your grace.
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
Your special mandate for the state-affairs
Hath hither brought.

 Nothing, but this is so.

 A maiden never bold;
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
It is a judgement maim'd and most imperfect
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
To find out practices of cunning hell,
Why this should be.   I therefore vouch again
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
He wrought upon her.

 I pray you, hear her speak:
If she confess that she was half the wooer,
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
Light on the man!   Come hither, gentle mistress:
Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience?

 God be wi' you! I have done.
Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Come hither, Moor:
I here do give thee that with all my heart
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
I am glad at soul I have no other child;
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
To hang clogs on them.   I have done, my lord.

 So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
But words are words; I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

 I'll not have it so.

 Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
She has deceived her father, and may thee.

My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.

 And mine, two hundred:
But though they jump not on a just account,--
As in these cases, where the aim reports,
'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

 This cannot be,
By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,
To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
And let ourselves again but understand,
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
So may he with more facile question bear it,
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
But altogether lacks the abilities
That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
To leave that latest which concerns him first,
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
To wake and wage a danger profitless.

  Ay, so I thought.   How many, as you guess?

 He's now in Florence.

 What, of Venice?

 I am glad to see you.

 What is the matter?

 'Tis a strange truth.

 Poor Desdemona!   I am glad thy father's dead:
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
And fall to reprobation.

 Fie!
Your sword upon a woman?

 The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.

 He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

 He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?

 May be the letter moved him;
For, as I think, they do command him home,
Deputing Cassio in his government.

 My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:
Make her amends; she weeps.

 Truly, an obedient lady:
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

 Who, I, my lord?

 Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,
Could neither graze nor pierce?

 Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?

 What, strike his wife!

 Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood,
And new-create this fault?

 I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
Exeunt. I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.

 Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

 Hark!

 Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
These may be counterfeits: let's think 't unsafe
To come in to the cry without more help.

 Hark!
Re-enter IAGO, with a light.
 We do not know.

 The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

 As you shall prove us, praise us.

 He, sir.

 Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

 Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.

 Wrench his sword from him.

 O thou Othello, that wert once so good,
Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave
What shall be said to thee?

 This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

 What, not to pray?

 Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
And here another: the one of them imports
The death of Cassio to be undertook
By Roderigo.

 Now here 's another discontented paper,
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
But that belike Iago in the interim
Came in and satisfied him.

 You must forsake this room, and go with us:
Your power and your command is taken off,
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
If there be any cunning cruelty
That can torment him much and hold him long,
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
Till that the nature of your fault be known
To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.

 O bloody period!

 O Spartan dog,
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
For they succeed on you.   To you, lord governor,

Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
To answer this your charge?

 What if I do obey?
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
Whose messengers are here about my side,
Upon some present business of the state
To bring me to him? Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
My very noble and approved good masters,
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her:
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent, no more.   Rude am I in my speech,
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace;
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith.
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field,
And little of this great world can I speak,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
What conjuration and what mighty magic,
For such proceeding I am charged withal,
I won his daughter.

 I do beseech you,
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
And let her speak of me before her father:
If you do find me foul in her report,
The trust, the office I do hold of you,
Not only take away, but let your sentence
Even fall upon my life.

 Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.
[Exeunt Iago and Attendants. 
And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
I do confess the vices of my blood,
So justly to your grave ears I'll present
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
And she in mine.

 Her father loved me; oft invited me;
Still question'd me the story of my life,
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
That I have pass'd.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field,
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach.
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
And portance in my travels' history:
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven,
It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not intentively: I aid consent,
And often did beguile her of her tears,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
And I loved her that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used:
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants.
 The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize
A natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness, and do undertake
These present wars against the Ottomites.
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
I crave fit disposition for my wife,
Due reference of place and exhibition,
With such accommodation and besort
As levels with her breeding. Nor I.

 Let her have your voices.
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
To please the palate of my appetite,
Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
In me defunct--and proper satisfaction,
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
I will your serious and great business scant
For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness
My speculative and officed instruments,
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
And all indign and base adversities
Make head against my estimation!

 With all my heart.

 So please your grace, my ancient;
A man he is of honesty and trust:
To his conveyance I assign my wife,
With what else needful your good grace shall think
To be sent after me.

 My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her;
And bring them after in the best advantage.
Come Desdemona; I have but an hour
Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
To spend with thee: we must obey the time.
[Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.
 O my fair warrior!

 It gives me wonder great as my content
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
If after every tempest come such calms,
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas
Olympus-high and duck again as low
As hell's from heaven!   If it were now to die,
'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
My soul hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate.

 Amen to that, sweet powers!
I cannot speak enough of this content;
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
And this, and this, the greatest discords be
[Kissing her.
That e'er our hearts shall make!

 Come, let us to the castle.
News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks are drown'd.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
Bring thou the master to the citadel;
He is a good one, and his worthiness
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
Once more, well met at Cyprus.
[Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and Attendants.
 Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
Let's teach ourselves that honorable stop,
Not to outsport discretion.

 Iago is most honest.
Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you.[To Desdemona] Come, my dear love,
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
Good night.
[Exeunt Othello, Desdemona, and Attendants.
Enter IAGO.
 What is the matter here?

 Hold, for your lives!

 Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
>From   her propriety.   What is the matter, masters?

Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.

 How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

 Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted, and your name is great
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
That you unlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.

 Now, by heaven,
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
And passion, having my best judgement collied,
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
Or do but lift this arm. the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
How this foul rant began, who set it on;
And he that is approved in this offence,
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
To manage private and domestic quarrel,
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
'Tis monstrous.   Iago, who began 't?

 I know, Iago,
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee;
But never more be officer of mine.
Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended.
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
I'll make thee an example.

 All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:
Lead him off.
[To Montano, who is led off.
Iago, look with care about the town,
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
[Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio. 
 These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
And by him do my duties to the senate:
That done, I will be walking on the works;
Repair there to me.

 This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see 't?

 What dost thou say?

 Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

 I do believe 'twas he.

 Who is't you mean?

 Went he hence now?

 Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.

 The sooner, sweet, for you.

 No, not to-night.

 I shall not dine at home;
I meet the captains at the citadel.

 Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing.

 I will deny thee nothing:
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
To leave me but a little to myself.

 Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.

 Excellent wretch!   Perdition catch my soul,
But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
Chaos is come again.

 What dost thou say, Iago?

 He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?

 Why of thy thought, Iago?

 O, yes; and went between us very oft.

 Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

 Honest! ay, honest.

 What dost thou think?

 Think my lord!
By heaven, he echoes me,
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
Show me thy thought.

 I think thou dost;
And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
They are close delations, working from   the heart
That passion cannot rule.

 I think so too.

 Certain, men should be what they seem.

 Nay, yet there's more in this:
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words.

 Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts.

 What dost thou mean?

 By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

 Ha!

 O misery!

 Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy,
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions?   No; to be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair,--feeds well, loves company,
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
Away at once with love or jealousy!

 Dost thou say so?

 And so she did.

 I am bound to thee for ever.

 Not a jot, not a jot.

 I will not.

 No, not much moved:
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

 And yet, how nature erring, from itself,--

 Farewell, farewell:
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago. Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds. Fear not my government.

 This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
Though that her jesses--were my dear heartstrings,
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have, or for I am declined
Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--
She's gone.   I am abused; and my relief
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
And not their appetites!   I had rather be a toad,
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
Prerogatived are they less than the base;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken.   Desdemona comes:
Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA.
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
I'll not believe 't.

 I am to blame.

 I have a pain upon my forehead here.

 Your napkin is too little:
He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops.
Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

 Ha! ha! false to me?

 Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
Than but to know't a little.

 What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
I saw 't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
Let him not know 't, and he 's not robb'd at all.

 I had been happy, if the general camp,
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,
Farewell!   Othello's occupation's gone!

 Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof;
Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul,
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my waked wrath!

 Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

 If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
On horror's head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that.

 Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.

 By the world,
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

 Would! nay, I will.

 Death and damnation! O!

 Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

 O monstrous! monstrous!

 But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

 I'll tear her all to pieces.

 I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.

 If it be that,--

 O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate!   Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!

 O, blood, blood, blood!

 Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic sea,
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up.   Now, by yond marble heaven,
Kneels
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words.

 I greet thy love,
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
And will upon the instant put thee to 't:
Within these three days let me hear thee say
That Cassio's not alive.

 Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

 Well, my good lady.   Aside
O, hardness to dissemble!--
How do you, Desdemona?

 Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.

 This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
Much castigation, exercise devout;
For here's a young and sweating devil here,
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
A frank one.

 A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

 What promise, chuck?

 I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
Lend me thy handkerchief.

 That which I gave you.

 Not?

 That is a fault.
That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
She was a charmer, and could almost read
The thoughts of people: she told her, while she kept it,
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
Or made a gift of it, my father's eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on 't;
Make it a darling like your precious eye;
To lose't or give't away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.

 'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses,
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
Conserved of maidens' hearts.

 Most veritable; therefore look to 't well.

 Ha! wherefore?

 Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way?

 Say you?

 How!

 Fetch 't, let me see 't.

 Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

 The handkerchief! The handkerchief!

 The handkerchief!

 Away!
Exit.
 Think so, Iago!

 An unauthorized kiss.

 Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil:
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

 What then?

 She is protectress of her honour too:
May she give that?

 By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
Thou said'st--O, it comes o'er my memory,
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.

 That's not so good now.

 Hath he said any thing?

 What hath he said?

 What? what?

 With her?

  Dost thou mock me?

 A horned man's a monster and a beast.

 Did he confess it?

 O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

 Dost thou hear, Iago?
I will be found most cunning in my patience;
But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.

 Look, how he laughs already!

 Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.

 Now he importunes him
To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.

 Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?

 So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.

 Have you scored me?   Well.

      O Iago!

 Was that mine?

      I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!

 With mine officer!

   What trumpet is that same?

 With all my heart, sir,

 I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
Opens letter, and reads. 
 Are you sure of that?

  Fire and brimstone!

 Are you wise?

 Indeed!

 I am glad to see you mad.

 Devil!

 O devil, devil!
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
Out of my sight!

 Mistress!

 What would you with her, sir?

 Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
Concerning   this, sir,--O well-painted passion!--
I am commanded home. Get you away;
I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
Exit Desdemona.
Cassio shall have my place.   And, sir, tonight,
I do entreat that we may sup together:
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!
Exit. 
 You have seen nothing then?

 Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

 What, did they never whisper?

 Nor send you out o' the way?

 To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

 That's strange.

 Bid her come hither: go.
Exit Emilia.
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets:
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA. 
 Pray, chuck, come hither.

 Let me see your eyes;
Look in my face.

 Some of your function, mistress;
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:
Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.
Exit Emilia.
 Why, what art thou?

 Come, swear it, damn thyself;
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
Swear thou art honest.

 Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

 O Desdemona! away! away! away!

 Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at!
Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
Where either I must live, or bear no life;
The fountain from the which my current runs,
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--
Ay, there, look grim as hell!

 O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
That quicken even with blowing.   O thou weed,
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!

 Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
Made to write 'whore' upon?   What committed!
Committed! O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks,
That would to cinders burn up modesty,
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth.
And will not hear it. What committed!
Impudent strumpet!

 Are not you a strumpet?

 What, not a whore?

 Is't possible?

 I cry you mercy, then:
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello. Raising his voice
You, mistress,
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
And keep the gate of hell!
Re-enter EMILIA.You, you, ay, you!
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.
Exit.
 O, pardon me; 'twill do me good to walk.

 Will you walk, sir?
O,--Desdemona,--

  The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.

 It is even so.

 'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,
That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.
Exit. 
Enter LODOVlCO and GRATIANO. 
 It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood.
Nor scar that whiter skin of her than snow,
And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light:
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
I can again thy former light restore,
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
I cannot give it vital growth again,
It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.
Kissing her. 
Ah, balmy breath, that doth almost persuade
Justice to break her sword!   One more, one more.
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

 Ay, Desdemona.

 Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

 If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
Solicit for it straight.

 Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

 Ay, I do.

 Amen, with all my heart!

 Hum!

 Think on thy sins.

 Ay, and for that thou diest.

 Peace, and be still!

 That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
Thou gavest to Cassio.

 Sweet soul, take heed,
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

 Yes, presently:
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
For to deny each article with oath
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

 I say, amen.

 By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
And makest me call what I intended to do
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
I saw the handkerchief.

 He hath confess'd.

 That he hath used thee.

 Ay.

 No, his mouth is stopp'd;
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

 Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
Had stomach for them all.

 Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?

 Down, strumpet!

 Nay, if you strive,--

 Being done, there is no pause.

 It is too late.
He stifles her.
 What noise is this?   Not dead? not yet quite dead?
I that am cruel am yet merciful;
I would not have thee linger in thy pain:
So, so. Who's there? Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good ?--
I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
My wife! my wife! what wife?   I have no wife.
O, insupportable!   O heavy hour!
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
Should yawn at alteration. I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia:
Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
Where art thou?
Unlocks the door.
Enter EMILIA.What's the matter with thee now?

 It is the very error of the moon;
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
And makes men mad.

 Roderigo kill'd!
And Cassio kill'd!

 Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
And sweet revenge grows harsh.

 That! what?

 Why, how should she be murder'd?

 You heard her say herself, it was not I.

 She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
'Twas I that kill'd her.

 She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

 She was false as water.

 Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
But that I did proceed upon just grounds
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.

 Thy husband.

 Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
If heaven would make me such another world
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,
I'ld not have sold her for it.

 Ay, 'twas he that told me first:
An honest man he is, and hates the slime
That sticks on filthy deeds.

 What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.

 He, woman;
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

 Ha!

 Peace, you were best.

 Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.

 O! O! O!
He falls on the bed.
 O, she was foul!
I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
I know this act shows horrible and grim.

 'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
And she did gratify his amorous works
With that recognizance and pledge of love
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
It was a handkerchief, an antique token
My father gave my mother.

 Are there no stones in heaven
But what serve for the thunder? Precious villain!
He runs at Iago: Iago, from behind, stabs Emilia, and exit.
 I am not valiant neither,
But every puny whipster gets my sword:
But why should honour outlive honesty?
Let it go all.

 I have another weapon in this chamber;
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:
O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth. Look in upon me then and speak with me,
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
Re-enter GRATIANO.
 Behold, I have a weapon;
A better never did itself sustain
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day
That, with this little arm and this good sword,
I have made my way through more impediments
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
And he retires. Where should Othello go?
Now, how dost thou look now?   O ill-starr'd wench!
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
Whip me, ye devils,
>From the possession of this heavenly sight!

Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Enter LODOVICO, MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner. 
 That's he that was Othello: here I am.

 I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.
Wounds Iago.
 I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

 Why, any thing:
An honourable murderer, if you will;
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

 Ay.

 I do believe it, and I ask you pardon.
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

 Well, thou dost best.

 O villain!

 O the pernicious caitiff!
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
That was my wife's?

 O fool! fool! fool!

 Soft you; a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service, and they know 't.
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
Albeit unused to the melting mood,
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
And smote him, thus.
Stabs himself.
 I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
Falls on the bed, and dies.
"
770,cas.,CASSIO,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-cas.," The duke does greet you, general,
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
Even on the instant.

 Something from   Cyprus, as I may divine:
It is a business of some heat: the galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another's heels,
And many of the consuls raised and met,
Are at the duke's already: you have been hotly call'd for;
When, being not at your lodging to be found,
The senate hath sent about three several quests
To search you out.

 Ancient, what makes he here?

 I do not understand.

 To who?
Re-enter OTHELLO.
 Here comes another troop to seek for you.

 Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
Give him defence against the elements,
For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.

 His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot
Of very expert and approved allowance;
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
Stand in bold cure.
[A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!']
Enter a fourth Gentleman.
 What noise?

 My hopes do shape him for the governor.
[Guns heard. 
 I pray you, sir, go forth,
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

 Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
That paragons description and wild fame;
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does tire the ingener.
Re-enter second Gentleman.
How now! who has put in?

 Has had most favorable and happy speed:
Tempests themselves, high seas and howling winds,
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands,--
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
As having sense of beauty, do omit
Their mortal natures, letting so safely by
The divine Desdemona.

 She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
Left in the conduct of the bold lago,
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits,
And bring all Cyprus comfort!
Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants.
O, behold,
The riches of the ship is come on shore!
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
Before, behind thee and on every hand,
Enwheel thee round!

 He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
But that he's well and will be shortly here.

 The great contention of the sea and skies
Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.
[Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard.
 See for the news.
[Exit Gentleman.
Good ancient, you are welcome. [To Emilia]
Welcome, mistress:
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
[Kissing her.
  'Tis truly so.

 Lo, where he comes!
Enter OTHELLO and Attendants.
 Iago hath direction what to do;
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
Will I look to't.

  She's a most exquisite lady.

 Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

  She is indeed perfection.

   Where are they?

 I'll do 't; but it dislikes me.
[Exit.
  'Fore God, an excellent song.

  To the health of our general!

      You rogue! you rascal!

 A knave teach me my duty!
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.

 Dost thou prate, rogue?
[Striking Roderigo.
 Let me go, sir,
Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.

 Drunk!
[They fight.
 I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

 Ay, past all surgery.

   I know not.

     You advise me well.

  Good night, honest Iago.
[Exit.
 Masters, play here; I will content your pains;
Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'
Music. 
Enter Clown.
 Dost thou hear, my honest friend?

  Do, good my friend.
Exit Clown.
Enter IAGO.
In happy time, Iago,

 Why, no; the day had broke
Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
To send in to your wife: my suit to her
Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access.

 I humbly thank you for't.       Exit Iago.
I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest.
Enter EMILIA.
 Yet, I beseech you,
If you think fit, or that it may be done,
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone.

 I am much bound to you.
Exeunt. Bounteous madam,
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
He's never any thing but your true servant.

 Ay, but, lady,
That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
That, I being absent and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service.

 Madam, I'll take my leave.

 Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
Unfit for mine own purposes.

 Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist, and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
Nor purposed merit in futurity,
Can ransom me into his love again,
But to know so must be my benefit;
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
And shut myself up in some other course,
To fortune's alms.

 I humbly thank your ladyship.
Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
Enter BIANCA.
 What make you from home?
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

 Pardon me, Bianca:
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd;
But I shall, in a more continuate time,
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
Giving her Desdemona's handkerchief.
Take me this work out.

 Go to, woman!
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
From whence you have them.   You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
No, in good troth, Bianca.

 I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
Take it, and do 't; and leave me for this time.

 I do attend here on the general;
And think it no addition, nor my wish,
To have him see me woman'd.

 Not that I love you not.

 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

 What's the matter?

 Rub him about the temples. The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me.

 Alas, poor caitiff!

 Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.

 Ha, ha, ha!

  Prithee, say true.

    Well, I must leave her company.

    'Faith, I intend so.

 Prithee, come; will you?

 That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
But that my coat is better than thou know'st:
I will make proof of thine.
Draws, and wounds Roderigo.
 I am maim'd for ever.   Help, ho! murder! murder!
Falls. 
Enter OTHELLO.
 O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!

 What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!

 O, help!

 Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!

 Iago?   O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
Give me some help.

 I think that one of them is hereabout,
And cannot make away.

 That's one of them.

 My leg is cut in two.

 No.

 None in the world; nor do I know the man. Dear general, I never gave you cause.

 Most heathenish and most gross!

 I found it in my chamber:
And he himself confess'd but even now
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
Which wrought to his desire.

 There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
Iago set him on.

 This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
For he was great of heart."
771,iago.,IAGO,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-iago.," 'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
If ever I did dream of such a matter,
Abhor me.

 Despise me, if I do not.   Three great ones of the city,
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
And, in conclusion,
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
'I have already chose my officer.'
And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
That never set a squadron in the field,
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practice,
Is all his soldiership.   But he, sir, had the election:
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.

 Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
Preferment goes by letter and affection,
And not by old gradation, where each second
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
Whether I in any just term am affined
To love the Moor.

 O, sir, content you;
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Cannot be truly follow'd.   You shall mark
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
In following him, I follow but myself;
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

 Call up her father,
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
As it may lose some color.

 Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
As when, by night and negligence, the fire
Is spied in populous cities.

 Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
Thieves! thieves!
BRABANTIO appears above, at a window.
 Are your doors lock'd?

 'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown;
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
Arise, I say.

   You are--a senator.

 Farewell; for I must leave you:
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
However this may gall him with some check,
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
Another of his fathom they have none,
To lead their business: in which regard,
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains,
Yet, for necessity of present life,
I must show out a flag and sign of love,
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.
[Exit.
Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches.
 Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

 Nay, but he prated,
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Against your honor
That, with the little godliness I have,
I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
Are you fast married?   Be assured of this,
That the magnifico is much beloved,
And hath in his effect a voice potential
As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
Will give him cable.

 Those are the raised father and his friends:
You were best go in.

 By Janus, I think no.
Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches.
 'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

 He's married.

 Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?

 It is Brabantio.   General, be advised;
He comes to bad intent.
Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons. 
 You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.

 What say'st thou, noble heart?

 Why, go to bed, and sleep.

      At my lodging.

 Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?

 No more of drowning, do you hear?

 Thus do I ever make my fool my purse;
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
If I would time expend with such a snipe,
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor;
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
He hath done my office: I know not if't be true;
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
The better shall my purpose work on him.
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
To get his place and to plume up my will
In double knavery--How, how ?--Let's see:--
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
That he is too familiar with his wife.
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected, framed to make women false.
The Moor is of a free and open nature,
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are.
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.
[Exit. 
 Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
You'ld have enough.

 In faith, too much;
I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
And chides with thinking.

 Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,
Players in your housewifery, and housewives in your beds.

 Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
You rise to play and go to bed to work.

 No, let me not.

 O gentle lady, do not put me to 't;
For I am nothing, if not critical.

 Ay, madam.

 I am about it; but indeed my invention
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labors,
And thus she is deliver'd.
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
The one's for use, the other useth it.

 If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

 She never yet was foolish that was fair;
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.

 There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

 She that was ever fair and never proud,
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
She that in wisdom never was so frail
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail,
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
See suitors following and not look behind,
She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--

 To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

 The Moor!
I know his trumpet.

  [Aside] O, you are well tuned now!
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
As honest as I am.

       That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great a sin,
But partly led to diet my revenge,
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgement cannot cure. Which thing to do,
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me,
For making him egregiously an ass
And practising upon his peace and quiet
Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
Knavery's plain face is never seen till used.
[Exit.      O, they are our friends; but one cup:
I'll drink for you.

   If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
As my young mistress' dog.   Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
That hold their honors in a wary distance,
The very elements of this warlike isle,
Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
Am I to put our Cassio in some action
That may offend the isle.--But here they come:
If consequence do but approve my dream,
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; Servants following with wine.
 Some wine, ho!
  [Sings] And let me the canakin clink, clink;
And let me the canakin clink:
A soldier's but a man;A life's but a span;
Why, then, let a soldier drink.
Some wine, boys!

   O sweet England!
King Stephen was a worthy peer, His breeches cost him but a crown;
He held them sixpence all too dear, With that he call'd the tailor lown.
He was a wight of high renown, And thou art but of low degree:
'Tis pride that pulls the country down; Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
Some wine, ho!

 Will you hear't again?

 It's true, good lieutenant.

 And so do I too, lieutenant.

 You see this fellow that is gone before;
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction: and do but see his vice;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.
I fear the trust Othello puts him in,
On some odd time of his infirmity,
Will shake this island.

 'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
He'll watch the horologe a double set,
If drink rock not his cradle.

  [Aside to him] How now, Roderigo!
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.
[Exit Roderigo,
 Not I, for this fair island:
I do love Cassio well; and would do much
To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?
[Cry within: 'Help! help!' 
Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO.
  Aside to Roderigo Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.
[Exit Roderigo. 
Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--
Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,-sir;--
Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!
[Bell rings. 
Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!
The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!
You will be shamed for ever.
Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants.
 Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--gentlemen,--
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!

 I do not know: friends all but now, even now,
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
As if some planet had unwitted men--
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
In opposition bloody.   I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds;
And would in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

 Touch me not so near:
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
Montano and myself being in speech,
There comes a fellow crying out for help;
And Cassio following him with determined sword,
To execute upon him.   Sir, this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
Lest by his clamor--as it so fell out--
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
For this was brief--I found them close together,
At blow and thrust; even as again they were
When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report:
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
>From him that fled some strange indignity,

Which patience, could not pass.

 What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

 Marry, heaven forbid!

   Is't possible?

       And what's he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest,
Probal to thinking and indeed the course
To win the Moor again?   For 'tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
As the free elements. And then for her
To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function.   How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
Directly to his good?   Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins put on,
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
That she repeals him for her body's lust;
And by how much she strives to do him good,
She shall undo her credit with the Moor,
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all.
Re-enter RODERIGO.
How now, Roderigo!

 How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
Though other things grow fair against the sun,
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
Content thyself awhile.   By the mass, 'tis morning;
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
Nay, get thee gone. [Exit Roderigo.] Two things are to be done:
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
I'll set her on;
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way:
Dull not device by coldness and delay.
[Exit. You have not been a-bed, then?

 I'll send her to you presently;
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way, that your converse and business
May be more free.

 Well, my good lord, I'll do't.

 Ha! I like not that.

 Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.

 Cassio, my lord!   No, sure, I cannot think it,
That he would steal away so guilty-like,
Seeing you coming.

 My noble lord,--

 Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
Know of your love?

 But for a satisfaction of my thought;
No further harm.

 I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

 Indeed!

 Honest, my lord!

 My lord, for aught I know.

 Think, my lord!

 My lord, you know I love you.

 For Michael Cassio
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

 Men should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

 Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.

 Good my lord, pardon me:
Though I am bound to every act of duty,
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Utter my thoughts?   Why, say they are vile and false;
As where's that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
With meditations lawful?

 I do beseech you--
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
From one that so imperfectly conceits,
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom
To let you know my thoughts.

 Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.

 You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

 O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on: that cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!

 Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy!

 I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
I would not have your free and noble nature,
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
I know our country disposition well;
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
Is not to leave 't undone, but keep't unknown.

 She did deceive her father, marrying you;
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
She loved them most.

 Why, go to then;
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
To seel her father's eyes up close as oak--
He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you.

 I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

 I' faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love.   But I do see you're moved:
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.

 Should you do so, my lord,
My speech should fall into such vile success
As my thoughts aim not at.   Cassio's my worthy friend--
My lord, I see you're moved.

 Long live she so! and long live you to think so!

 Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
Whereto we see in all things nature tends-
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.
But pardon me; I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
Her will, recoil ng to her better judgement,
May fall to match you with her country forms
And happily repent.

 My lord, I take my leave.

 My lord, I would I might entreat your honour
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
For, sure, he fills it up with great ability,
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
You shall by that perceive him and his means:
Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity;
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

 I once more take my leave.
Exit.
 How now! what do you here alone?

 A thing for me? it is a common thing--

 To have a foolish wife.

 What handkerchief?

 Hast stol'n it from her?

 A good wench; give it me.

 Why, what's that to you?

 Be not acknown on't; I have use for it.
Go, leave me.
Exit Emilia. 
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
And let him find it. Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ: ths may do something.
The Moor already changes with my poison:
Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons,
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
But with a little act upon the blood,
Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so:
Look, where he comes!
Re-enter OTHELLO.
Not poppy, nor mandragora,
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Which thou owedst yesterday.

 Why, how now, general! no more of that.

 How now, my lord!

 I am sorry to hear this.

 Is't possible, my lord?

 Is 't come to this?

 My noble lord,--

 O grace! O heaven forgive me!
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool,
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this profit; and from hence
I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.

 I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
And loses that it works for.

 I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?

 And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on-
Behold her topp'd?

 It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own! What then? how then?
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this,
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
If imputation and strong circumstances,
Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.

 I do not like the office:
But, sith, I am enter'd in this cause so far,
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
One of this kind is Cassio:
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg
Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'

 Nay, this was but his dream.

 And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly.

 Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

 I know not that: but such a handkerchief--
I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
See Cassio wipe his beard with.

 If it be that, or any that was hers,
It speaks against her with the other proofs.

 Yet be content.

 Patience, I say, your mind perhaps may change.

 Do not rise yet.
Kneels
Witness, you   ever-burning   lights above,
You elements that clip us round about,
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
And to obey shall be in me remorse,
What bloody business ever.
They rise.
 My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
But let her live.

 I am your own for ever.
Exeunt. There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
And, lo, the happiness I go, and importune her.

 Is my lord angry?

 Can he be angry?   I have seen the cannon,
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
And, like the devil, from his very arm
Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.

 Will you think so?

 To kiss in private?

 Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

 So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--

 Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

 Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
They have it very oft that have it not:
But, for the handkerchief,--

 Ay, what of that?

 What,
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,
Who having, by their own importunate suit,
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
But they must blab--

 He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
No more than he'll unswear.

 'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.

 Lie--

 With her, on her; what you will.

 Work on,
My medicine, work!   Thus credulous fools are caught;
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
My lord, I say! Othello!
Enter CASSIO.
How now, Cassio!

 My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.

 No, forbear;
The lethargy must have his quiet course:
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by
Breaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs:
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
He will recover straight: when he is gone,
I would on great occasion speak with you.
Exit Cassio,
How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?

 I mock you! no, by heaven.
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!

 There's many a beast then in a populous city,
And many a civil monster.

 Good sir, be a man;
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
May draw with you: there's millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
And to suppose her chaste!   No, let me know;
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

 Stand you awhile apart;
Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
A passion most unsuiting such a man--
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
That dwell in every region of his face;
For I will make him tell the tale anew,
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
And nothing of a man.

 That's not amiss;
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
Othello retires.
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
A housewife that by selling her desires
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:

Re-enter CASSIO.
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behaviour,
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

 Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
Speaking lower
Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's power,
How quickly should you speed!

 I never knew woman love man so.

 Do you hear, Cassio?

 She gives it out that you shall marry her:
Do you intend it?

  I am a very villain else.

 Before me! look, where she comes.

 After her, after her.

 Will you sup there?

 Well, I may chance to see you; for
I would very fain speak with you.

 Go to; say no more.
Exit Cassio.  And did you see the handkerchief?

  Nay, you must forget that.

 Nay, that's not your way.

 She's the worse for all this.

 Ay, too gentle.

  O, 'tis foul in her.

 That's fouler.

   Something from   Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.
Enter LODOViCO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants.
 I am very glad to see you, signior;
Welcome to Cyprus.

 Lives, sir.

 He is much changed.

 He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
What he might be: if what he might he is not,
I would to heaven he were!

 'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
That stroke would prove the worst!

 Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak
What I have seen and known.   You shall observe him,
And his own courses will denote him so
That I may save my speech: do but go after,
And mark how he continues.

 What is your pleasure, madam? How is't with you?

 What's the matter, lady?

 What name, fair lady?

 Why did he so?

 Do not weep, do not weep.   Alas the day!

 Beshrew him for't!
How comes this trick upon him?

 Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.

 Speak within door.

 You are a fool; go to.

 I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
The business of the state does him offence,
And he does chide with you.

 'Tis but so, I warrant.
Trumpets within.
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
The messengers of Venice stay the meat:
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
Enter RODERIGO.
How now, Roderigo!

 What in the contrary?

 Will you hear me, Roderigo?

 You charge me most unjustly.

 Well; go to; very well.

 Very well.

 You have said now.

     Why, by making him uncapable of
Othello's place; knocking out his brains.

  And you shall be satisfied.
Exeunt. Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
And fix most firm thy resolution.

 Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.
Retires. 
 I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
He calls me to a restitution large
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
As gifts to Desdemona;
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.
Enter CASSIO.
 Who's there? whose noise is this that cries on murder?

 Did not you hear a cry?

 What's the matter?

 What are you here that cry so grievously?

 O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?

 O treacherous villains!
What are you there? come in, and give some help.
To Lodovico and Gratiano, 
 O murderous slave! O villain!
Stabs Roderigo,
 Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
How silent is this town!   Ho! murder! murder!--
What may you be? are you of good or evil?

 Signior Lodovico?

 I cry you mercy.   Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

 How is 't, brother!

 Marry, heaven forbid!
Light, gentlemen: I'll bind it with my shirt.
Enter BIANCA.
 Who is't that cried!

 O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
Who they should be that have thus mangled you?

 Lend me a garter.   So.   O, for a chair,
To bear him easily hence!

 Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
To be a party in this injury.
Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman
Roderigo! no:--yes, sure:--O heaven! Roderigo.

 Even he, sir: did you know him?

 Signior Gratiano?   I cry you gentle pardon;
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
That so neglected you.

 How do you, Cassio?   O, a chair, a chair!

 He, he, 'tis he.   A chair brought in.
O, that's well said; the chair.
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
I'll fetch the general's surgeon. To Bianca
For you, mistress,
Save you your labour. He that lies slain here, Cassio,
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?

 What, look you pale?
O, bear him out o' the air.
Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.
Stay you, good gentlemen.   Look you pale, mistress?
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
Though tongues were out of use.
Enter EMILIA.
 Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.

 This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
To Bianca
What, do you shake at that?

 O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.

 Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
Emilia, run you to the citadel,
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
Will you go on?   I pray.   Aside
This is the night
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
Exeunt. I told him what I thought, and told no more
Than what he found himself was apt and true.

 I did.

 With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.

 What, are you mad?   I charge you, get you home.

 Come, hold your peace.

 Be wise, and get you home.

 Villanous whore!

 Filth, thou liest!

 I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

 Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
>From this time forth I never will speak word.



"
772,rod.,RODERIGO,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-rod.," Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

 Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

 By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

 I would not follow him then.

 What a full fortune does the thicklips owe,
If he can carry't thus!

 Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

 What, ho, Brabantio!   Signior Brabantio, ho!

 Signior, is all your family within?

 Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

 My name is Roderigo.

 Sir, sir, sir,--

 Patience, good sir.

 Most grave Brabantio,
In simple and pure soul I come to you.

 Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
If 't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
Transported, with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor,--
If this be known to you and your allowance,
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
But if you know not this, my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
That, from the sense of all civility,
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and every where.   Straight satisfy yourself:
If she be in her chamber or your house,
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you.

 Truly, I think they are.

 Yes, sir, I have indeed.

 I think I can discover him, if you please
To get good guard and go along with me.

 Signior, it is the Moor.

 Iago,--

 What will I do, thinkest thou?

 I will incontinently drown myself.

   It cannot be.

  Where shall we meet i' the morning?

 I'll be with thee betimes.

 What say you?

  With him! why, 'tis not possible.

   Well.

  Adieu.
[Exit.
 Beat me!

         It hath not appeared.

  Is that true? why, then Othello and
Desdemona return again to Venice.

 How do you mean, removing of him?

 And that you would have me to do?

 I will hear further reason for this.

 Be near at hand; I may miscarry in 't.

 I have no great devotion to the deed;
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.

 I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!
Makes a pass at Cassio. 
 O, I am slain!
Iago from behind wounds Cassio in the leg, and exit.
 O, villain that I am!

 O wretched villains!

 Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.

 O, help me here!

 O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!

"
773,mon.,MONTANO,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-mon.," What from the cape can you discern at sea?

 Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
Can hold the mortise?   What shall we hear of this?

 If that the Turkish fleet
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd;
It is impossible they bear it out.
Enter a third Gentleman.
 How! is this true?

 I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor. Pray heavens he be;
For I have served him, and the man commands
Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
As well to see the vessel that's come in
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
An indistinct regard.

 Is he well shipp'd?

 But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?

 What is she?

    But is he often thus?

 It were well
The general were put in mind of it.
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?
Enter RODERIGO.
 And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
Should hazard such a place as his own second
With one of an ingraft infirmity:
It were an honest action to say
So to the Moor.

 What's the matter, lieutenant?

 Nay, good lieutenant;
[Staying him.
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

 Come, come, you're drunk.

 'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
[Faints. 
 Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--
While I spare speech, which something now offends me,--
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
By me that's said or done amiss this night;
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us.

 If partially affined, or leagued in office,
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
Thou art no soldier.

 What is the matter?   How now, general!

 O monstrous act!

 'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
But kill him   rather.   I'll after that same villain,
For 'tis a damned slave.
Exeunt Montana and Cratiano.

     "
775,des.,DESDEMONA,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-des.," My noble father,
I do perceive here a divided duty:
To you I am bound for life and education;
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
And so much duty as my mother show'd
To you, preferring you before her father,
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord.

 Nor I; I would not there reside,
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
And let me find a charter in your voice,
To assist my simpleness.

 That I did love the Moor to live with him,
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord:
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
And to his honors and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

 I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

 O, but I fear--How lost you company?

 Alas, she has no speech.

 O, fie upon thee, slanderer!

 What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?

 Come on, assay. There's one gone to the harbor?

 I am not merry; but I do beguile
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

 Well praised! How if she be black and witty?

 Worse and worse.

   To do what?

  Let's meet him and receive him.

 My dear Othello!

 The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase,
Even as our days do grow!

 What's the matter?

 Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf.

 O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.

 I know't; I thank you.   You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a politic distance.

 Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him   tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle every thing he does
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.

 Why, stay, and hear me speak.

 Well, do your discretion.
Exit Cassio.
Enter OTHELLO and IAGO.
 How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here,
A man that languishes in your displeasure.

 Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
If I have any grace or power to move you,
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgement in an honest face:
I prithee, call him back.

 Ay, sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me,
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

 But shall 't be shortly?

 Shall't be to-night at supper?

 To-morrow dinner, then?

 Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
Out of their best--is not almost a fault
To incur a private check. When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--

 Why, this is not a boon;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted.

 Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

 Emilia, come.   Be as your fancies teach you;
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
 How now, my dear Othello!
Your dinner, and the generous islanders
By you invited, do attend your presence.

 Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?

 'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
It will be well.

 I am very sorry that you are not well.
Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.
  Why, man?

 Go to: where lodges he?

 Can any thing be made of this?

   Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

 Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are, it were enough
To put him to ill thinking.

 Who, he?   I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him.

 I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be call'd to him.
Enter OTHELLO.
How is't with you, my lord?

 Well, my good lord.

 It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

 You may, indeed, say so;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

 I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

 I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

 Here, my lord.

 I have it not about me.

 No, indeed, my lord.

 Is't possible?

 Indeed! is't true?

 Then would to God that I had never seen 't!

 Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

 Heaven bless us!

 It is not lost; but what an if it were?

 I say, it is not lost.

 Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit:
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

 Come, come;
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

 I pray, talk me of Cassio.

 A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
Shared dangers with you,--

 In sooth, you are to blame.

 I ne'er saw this before.
Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

 How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?

 Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

 I prithee, do so.
Exit Iago.Something, sure, of state,
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practice
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
Though great ones are their object.   'Tis even so;
For let our finger ache, and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
Nor of them look for such observances
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much. Emilia,
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
And he's indicted falsely.

 Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

 Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

 I will go seek him.   Cassio, walk here about:
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

 And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

 Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

 My lord? A most unhappy one: I would do much
To atone them, for the love I bear Cassio.

 My lord?

 What, is he angry?

 Trust me, I am glad on't.

 My lord?

 Why, sweet Othello,-- I have not deserved this.

 I will not stay to offend you.
Going.
 My lord?

 My lord, what is your will?

 What is your pleasure?

 What horrible fancy's this? Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words,
But not the words.

 Your wife, my lord; your true
And loyal wife.

 Heaven doth truly know it.

 To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

 Alas the heavy day!   Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me: if you have lost him,
Why, I have lost him too.

 I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

 Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

 By heaven, you do me wrong.

 No, as I am a Christian:
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
>From any other foul unlawful touch

Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

 No, as I shall be saved.

 O, heaven forgive us!

 Faith, half asleep.

 With who?

 Who is thy lord?

 I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
But what should go by water.   Prithee, tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
And call thy husband hither.

 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO.
 I cannot tell.   Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.

 Am I that name, Iago?

 Such as she says my lord did say I was.

 I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

 It is my wretched fortune.

 Nay, heaven doth know.

 If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

 O good Iago,
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Delighted them in any other form;
Or that I do not yet, and ever did,
And ever will--though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement:--love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me!   Unkindness may do much;
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love.   I cannot say 'whore:'
It doth abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

 If 'twere no other,--

 Your honour is most welcome.

 My lord?

 I will, my lord.
Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and Attendants.
 He says he will return incontinent:
He hath commanded me to go to bed,
And bade me to dismiss you.

 It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
We must not now displease him.

 So would not I: my love doth so approve him,
That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns,--
Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.

 All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me
In one of those same sheets.

 My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
And she died singing it: that song to-night
Will not go from   my mind; I have much to do,
But to go hang my head all at one side,
And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.

 No, unpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.

 He speaks well.

 The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
Sing all a green willow;
Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
Sing willow, willow, willow:
The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
Sing willow, willow, willow;
Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;
Lay by these:--
Singing
Sing willow, willow, willow;
Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--
Singing
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,--
Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?

 I call'd my love false love; but what said he then?
Sing willow, willow, willow:
If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men.--
So, get thee gone; good night.   Mine eyes do itch;
Doth that bode weeping?

 I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind?

 Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

 No, by this heavenly light!

 Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

 In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

 Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world.

 I do not think there is any such woman.

 Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
Exeunt, Who's there? Othello?

 Will you come to bed, my lord?

 Ay, my lord.

 Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

 Talk you of killing?

 Then heaven
Have mercy on me!

 If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

 And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

 They are loves I bear to you.

 That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope,
They do not point on me.

 I will so. What's the matter?

 No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man, and ask him.

 Ay, but not yet to die.

 Then Lord have mercy on me!

 And have you mercy too!   I never did
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love; I never gave him token.

 He found it then;
I never gave it him: send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.

 What, my lord?

 How? unlawfully?

 He will not say so.

 O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

 Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

 O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

 Kill me to-morrow: let me live tonight!

 But half an hour!

 But while I say one prayer!

 O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

 A guiltless death I die.

 Nobody; I myself.   Farewell:
Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!
Dies.
"
776,emil.,EMILIA,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-emil.," You have little cause to say so.

 You shall not write my praise.

 How if fair and foolish?

 Good morrow, good lieutenant: I am sorry
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it;
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you, but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again.

 Pray you, come in:
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom   freely.

 Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
As if the case were his.

 Madam, here comes my lord.

 I am glad I have found this napkin:
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
And give't Iago: what he will do with it
Heaven knows, not I;
I nothing but to please his fantasy.
Re-enter IAGO.
 Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

 Ha!

 O, is that all?   What will you give me now
For that same handkerchief?

 What handkerchief!
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
That which so often you did bid me steal.

 No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence,
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took 't up.
Look, here it is.

 What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
To have me filch it? If it be not for some purpose of import,
Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
When she shall lack it.

 I know not, madam.

 Is he not jealous?

 Look, where he comes.

 Is not this man jealous?

 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
They eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
They belch us.   Look you, Cassio and my husband!
Enter CAsslo and IAGO.
 He went hence but now,
And certainly in strange unquietness.

 Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you.

 But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.

 Lady, amen.

 Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

 But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

 Never, my lord.

 Never.

 Never, my lord.

 I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.

 Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

 Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

 Why, with my lord, madam.

 He that is yours, sweet lady.

 Here's a change indeed!
Exit.
 Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
As true hearts cannot bear.

 He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.

 Hath   she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

 I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

 A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!

 O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

 How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.

 Dismiss me!

 I would you had never seen him!

 I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

 Come, come, you talk.

 Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

 A very handsome man.

  It's the wind. 'Tis neither here nor there.

 There be some such, no question.

 Why, would not you?

 Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
I might do't as well i' the dark.

 The world's a huge thing: it is a great price
For a small vice.

   Yes, a dozen; and as many to the
Vantage as would store the world they played for.
But I do think it is their husbands' faults
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
Or scant our former having in despite;
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Yet have we some revenge.   Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others?   Is it sport?
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
I think it doth: is 't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too: and have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well: else let them know,
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

 'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

 Alas, good gentlemen alas, good Cassio!

 Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

 As I! foh! fie upon thee!

 My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!

 What, ho! my lord, my lord!

 O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!

 I do beseech you
That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!

 O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

 But now, my lord.

 Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
Call'd Roderigo.

 No, Cassio is not kill'd.

 Alas, what cry is that?

 Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
Help! help, ho! help!   O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona!   O sweet mistress, speak!

 O, who hath done this deed?

 Alas, who knows?

 She said so: I must needs report the truth.

 O, the more angel she,
And you the blacker devil!

 Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

 Thou art rash as fire, to say
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

 My husband!

 That she was false to wedlock?

 My husband!

 My husband!

 O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love!
My husband say that she was false!

 If he say so, may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

 Do thy worst:
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her.

 Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
I care not for thy sword: I'll make thee known,
Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress!   Murder! murder!
Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others.
 O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
That men must lay their murders on your neck.

 Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
Speak, for my heart is full.

 But did you ever tell him she was false?

 You told a lie; an odious, damned lie;
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
She false with Cassio!--did   you say with Cassio?

 I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--

 And your reports have set the murder on.

 Villany, villany, villany!
I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--
I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
O villany. villany!

 Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

 Nay, lay thee down and roar;
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
That e'er did lift up eye. O heaven! O heavenly powers!

 'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

 I will not.
Iago offers to stab Emilia.
 O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
I found by fortune and did give my husband;
For often, with a solemn earnestness,
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
He begg'd of me to steal it.

 She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
And I did give't my husband.

 By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
Do with so good a woman?

 Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

 What did thy song bode, lady.
Hark, canst thou hear me?   I will play the swan,
And die in music. Singing
Willow, willow, willow.--
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
Dies.

777,bian.,BIANCA,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-bian.," Save you, friend Cassio!

 And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
More tedious than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!

 O Cassio, whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend:
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
Is't come to this? Well, well.

 Why, whose is it?

 Leave you! wherefore?

 Why, I pray you?

 But that you do not love me.
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
And say if I shall see you soon at night.

 'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.
Exeunt.    What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?

 O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio!
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

782,gent.,Gentlemen,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-gent.," Nothing at all: it is a high-wrought flood;
I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
Descry a sail.

 A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
Seems to cast water on the burning bear,
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
I never did like molestation view
On the enchafed flood.

 News, lads! our wars are done.
This desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
On most part of their fleet.

 The ship is here put in,
A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.

 But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
With foul and violent tempest.

 Come, let's do so;
For every minute is expectancy
Of more arrivance.
Enter CASSIO.
 The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'

 They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
Our friends at least.

 I shall.

This likewise is a friend.

785,pri.,PRIAM,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-pri.," After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--
As honor, loss of time, travail, expense,
Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to 't? What noise? what shriek is this? Paris, you speak
Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
You have the honey still, but these the gall;
So to be valiant is no praise at all. Come, Hector, come, go back:
Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;
Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself
Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
To tell thee that this day is ominous:
Therefore, come back. Ay, but thou shalt not go. Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!          
[Exeunt severally Priam and Hector.
Alarums."
786,hect.,HECTOR,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-hect.," Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
As far as toucheth my particular,Yet, dread Priam,                            
There is no lady of more softer bowels,
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
If we have lost so many tenths of ours,      
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
Had it our name, the value of one ten,
What merit's in that reason which denies
The yielding of her up? Brother, she is not worth what she doth costThe holding. But value dwells not in particular will;
It holds his estimate and dignity
As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
To make the service greater than the god;
And the will dotes that is attributive
To what infectiously itself affects,
Without some image of the affected merit.  It is Cassandra.                    
           Enter CASSANDRA, raving. Peace, sister, peace! Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
Of divination in our sister work
Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
Can qualify the same? Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
And on the cause and question now in hand
Have glozed, but superficially: not much
Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
The reasons you allege do more conduce
To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
Than to make up a free determination      
'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Of any true decision. Nature craves
All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
What nearer debt in all humanity
Than wife is to the husband? If this law
Of nature be corrupted through affection,
And that great minds, of partial indulgence
To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
There is a law in each well-order'd nation 
To curb those raging appetites that are
Most disobedient and refractory.
If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
As it is known she is, these moral laws
Of nature and of nations speak aloud
To have her back return'd: thus to persist
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,
My spritely brethren, I propend to you     
In resolution to keep Helen still,
For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
Upon our joint and several dignities. I am yours,
You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
I was advertised their great general slept, 
Whilst emulation in the army crept:
This, I presume, will wake him.
[Exeunt. Why, then will I no more:
Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;   
The obligation of our blood forbids
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,
And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member 
Wherein my sword had not impressure made
Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:
By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
Cousin, all honor to thee! Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
A thought of added honor torn from Hector. We'll answer it;
The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell. AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
And signify this loving interview
To the expecters of our Trojan part;
Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
 The worthiest of them tell me name by name; 
But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
Shall find him by his large and portly size. I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon. Who must we answer? O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;
Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.  O, pardon; I offend. Let me enbrace thee, good old chronicle,
That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee. I would they could. I know your favor, Lord Ulysses, well.
Ah, sir, there 's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
Since I first saw yourself and Diomed
In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy. I must not believe you:
There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
And that old common arbitrator, Time,
Will one day end it. Is this Achilles? Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee. Nay, I have done already. O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
But there's more in me than thou understand'st. 
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye? It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
To answer such a question: stand again:
Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
As to prenominate in nice conjecture       
Where thou wilt hit me dead? Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
I'll not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;
For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
His insolence draws folly from my lips;
But I'll endeavor deeds to match these words,
Or may I never-- I pray you, let us see you in the field:
We have had pelting wars, since you refused
The Grecians' cause. Thy hand upon that match.  I trouble you. Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.  Good night, sweet Lord Menelaus. Give me your hand. And so, good night.
[Exit Diomedes; Ulysses and Troilus following. You train me to offend you; get you in:
By all the everlasting gods, I'll go! No more, I say.
               Enter CASSANDRA. Ho! bid my trumpet sound. Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear. Hold you still, I say;
Mine honor keeps the weather of my fate:
Life every man holds dear; but the brave man
Holds honor far more precious-dear than life.
                Enter TROILUS.
How now, young man!   mean'st thou to fight to-day? No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth, 
I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
Let grow thy sinews till knots be strong,
And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy. What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it. O, 'tis fair play. How now! how now! Fie, savage, fie! Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.  AEneas is a-field;
And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
Even in the faith of valor, to appear
This morning to them. I must not break my faith.         
You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
To take that course by your consent and voice,
Which you do forbid me, royal Priam. Andromache, I am offended with you:
Upon the love you bear me, get you in.                             
[Exit Andromache.  You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night. What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?
Art thou of blood and honor?  Yea, Troilus?   O, well fought, my youngest brother!
                Enter ACHILLES. Pause, if thou wilt. Fare thee well:
I would have been much more a fresher man,
Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!
               Re-enter TROILUS. Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
No? wilt thou not?   I like thy armor well;
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not, beast, abide? 
Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
[Exeunt.
 Most putrefied core, so fair without,
Thy goodly armor thus hath cost thy life.
Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him.
 Enter ACHILLES and Myrmidons. I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek."
787,tro.,TROILUS,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-tro.," Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
That find such cruel battle here within?
Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none. The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;
But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance, 
Less valiant than the virgin in the night
And skilless as unpractised infancy. Have I not tarried? Have I not tarried? Still have I tarried. Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
At Priam's royal table do I sit;
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,-- 
So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence? I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness. O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
Reply not in how many fathoms deep        
They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
In whose comparison all whites are ink,
Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,
As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm, 
Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
The knife that made it.   What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?     Peace, you ungracious clamors! peace, rude sounds!
Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
I cannot fight upon this argument;
It is too starved a subject for my sword.
But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo,
As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit. 
Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
Between our Ilium and where she resides,
Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,
Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.
Alarum. Enter AENEAS. Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
For womanish it is to be from thence.       
What news, AEneas, from the field to-day? By whom, AEneas? Let Paris bleed: 'tis but a scar to scorn;
Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn. [Alarum.  Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither? Come, go we then together.
[Exeunt. Fie, fie, my brother!
Weigh you the worth and honor of a king
So great as our dread father in a scale
Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
The past proportion of his infinite?
And buckle in a waist most fathomless       
With spans and inches so diminutive
As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame! You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:
You know an enemy intends you harm;
You know a sword employ'd is perilous,   
And reason flies the object of all harm:
Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
The very wings of reason to his heels
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honor
Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat their thoughts
With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
Make livers pale and lustihood deject.    What is aught, but as 'tis valued? I take to-day a wife, and my election
Is led on in the conduct of my will;
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
Of will and judgement: how may I avoid,
Although my will distaste what it elected,
The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
To blench from this and to stand firm by honor:
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,
When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands 
We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
Because we now are full. It was thought meet
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks
Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl, 
Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--
If you'll confess he brought home noble prize-
As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands,
And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
And do a deed that fortune never did,      
Beggar the estimation which you prized
Richer than sea and land?   O, theft most base,
That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,
That in their country did them that disgrace,
We fear to warrant in our native place!
 'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice. Why, brother Hector,
We may not think the justness of each act
Such and no other than event doth form it, 
Nor once deject the courage of our minds,
Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
Which hath our several honors all engaged
To make it gracious. For my private part,
I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
To fight for and maintain! Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:
Were it not glory that we more affected
Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
She is a theme of honor and renown,
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds, 
Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
And fame in time to come canonize us;
For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
So rich advantage of a promised glory
As smiles upon the forehead of this action
For the wide world's revenue.  No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks 
Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,
And give me swift transportance to those fields
Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
Proposed for the deserver!   O gentle Pandarus,
From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings,
And fly with me to Cressid! I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
The imaginary relish is so sweet           
That it enchants my sense: what will it be,
When that the watery palate tastes indeed
Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,
Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,
For the capacity of my ruder powers:
I fear it much; and I do fear besides,
That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
The enemy flying.                            
              Re-enter PANDARUS. Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:
My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;
And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
Like vassalage at unawares encountering     
The eye of majesty. Re-enter PANDARUS mith CRESSIDA.         Why was my Cressid then so hard to win? And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence. Your leave, sweet Cressid! What offends you, lady? You cannot shunYourself. Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely. O, that I thought it could be in a woman--
As, if it can, I will presume in you--
To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,
That my integrity and truth to you
Might be affronted with the match and weight
Of such a winnow'd purity in love;
How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
I am as true as truth's simplicity
And smipler than the infancy of truth. O virtuous fight,
When right with right wars who shall be most right!
True swains in love shall in the world to come
Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes, 
Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
Want similes, truth tired with iteration,
As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,
Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
As truth's authentic author to be cited,
'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,
And sanctify the numbers.  Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold. Trouble him not;
To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,
And give as soft attachment to thy senses
As infants' empty of all thought! I prithee now, to bed. O Cressida! but that the busy day,
Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer, 
I would not from thee. Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
You will catch cold, and curse me. It is your uncle.                         Is it so concluded? How my achievements mock me!
I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,
We met by chance; you did not find me here. Walk into her house;
I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
And to his hand when I deliver her,
Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
A priest there offering to it his own heart.             
[Exit.  Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,
That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,
More bright in zeal than the devotion which
Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me. A hateful truth. From Troy and Troilus. And suddenly; where injury of chance
Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
Even in the birth of our own laboring breath:
We two, that with so many thousand sighs 
Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
Injurious time now with a robber's haste
Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:
As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
He fumbles up into a loose adieu,
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.       Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
Bid them have patience; she shall come anon. No remedy. Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--  Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
For it is parting from us:
I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,
For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
That there's no maculation in thy heart:
But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in
My sequent protestation; be thou true,
And I will see thee. And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve. I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,
To give thee nightly visitation.
But yet be true. Hear why I speak it, love:
The Grecian youths are full of quality;
They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,
Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise: 
How novelty may move, and parts with person,
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--
Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--
Makes me afeard. Die I a villain, then!
In this I do not call your faith in question
So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,
Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant: 
But I can tell that in each grace of these
There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted. No.But something may be done that we will not:
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
Presuming on their changeful potency. Come, kiss; and let us part.  Good brother, come you hither;
And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you. Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.
Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS,
                 and DIOMEDES. 
Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady   
Which for Antenor we deliver you:
At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand;
And by the way possess thee what she is.
Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
Name Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe
As Priam is in Ilion. Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,
To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,
She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;
For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
I'll cut thy throat. Come, to the port.   I'll tell thee, Diomed,
This brave shall oft make thee to hide they head.
Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
To our own selves bend we our needful talk.   
[Exeunt Troilus, Cressida, and Diomedes.
[Trumpet within. Hector, thou sleep'st;Awake thee! My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
In what place of the field doth Calchas keep? Shall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
To bring me thither? O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars 
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:
But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.                    
[Exeunt.  Sweet sir, you honor me. Cressid comes forth to him. Yea, so familiar! What should she remember? Hold, patience! Thy better must. O plague and madness! Behold, I pray you! I pray thee, stay. I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments,
I will not speak a word! Doth that grieve thee?O wither'd truth! By Jove,I will be patient. She strokes his cheek! Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
There is between my will and all offences
A guard of patience: stay a little while. Fear me not, sweet lord;
I will not be myself, nor have cognition
Of what I feel: I am all patience.
               Re-enter CRESSIDA. O beauty! where is thy faith? I will be patient; outwardly I will. I did swear patience. Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,
It should be challenged. It is. To make a recordation to my soul
Of every syllable that here was spoke.
But if I tell how these two did co-act,
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart, 
An esperance so obstinately strong,
That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,
As if those organs had deceptious functions,
Created only to calumniate,
Was Cressid here? She was not, sure. Why, my negation hath no taste of madness. Let it not be believed for womanhood!
Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage
To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme, 
For depravation, to square the general sex
By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid. Nothing at all, unless that this were she. This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:
If beauty have a soul, this is not she;
If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
If sanctimony by the gods' delight,          
If there be rule in unity itself,
This is not she. O madness of discourse,
That cause sets up with and against itself!
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
With revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
And yet the spacious breadth of this division
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle     
As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:
Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;
The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;
And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics 
Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed. Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well
In characters as red as Mars his heart
Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
That sleeve is mine that he I'll bear on his helm;
Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,
My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout 
Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,
Shall dizzy with more clamor Neptune's ear
In his descent than shall my prompted sword
Falling on Diomed. O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
And they'll seem glorious. Have with you, prince.   My courteous lord, adieu,
Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,
Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head! Accept distracted thanks.        
[Exeunt Troilus, AEneas, and Ulysses.  Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
Which better fits a lion than a man. When many times the captive Grecian falls, 
Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
You bid them rise, and live. Fool's play, by heaven, Hector. For the love of all the gods,
Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,
And when we have our armors buckled on,
The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,
Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth. Hector, then 'tis wars. Who should withhold me?
Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;
Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;
Nor you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,
But by my ruin. 
Re-enter CASSANDRA, with PRIAM. This foolish, dreaming superstitious girl
Makes all these bodements. Away! away! They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.
                Enter PANDARUS.   Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart;
The effect doth operate another way.
[Tearing the letter.
Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together. 
My love with words and errors still she feeds;
But edifies another with her deeds.

[Exeunt severally. Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx, 
I would swim after. O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,
And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse! Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!
[Exeunt, fighting. 
                 Enter HECTOR. Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?
No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too,
Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
I reck not though I end my life to-day.
Exit.
 Enter one in sumptuous armor.  Hector is slain. He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,
In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
Sit gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
And linger not our sure destructions on! You understand me not that tell me so:
I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
But dare all imminence that gods and men
Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,
Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:
There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word, 
Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:
Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
Let Titan rise as early as he dare.
I'll through and through you! and, thou greatsized coward,
No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
[Exeunt AEneas and Trojans.
As TROILUS is going out, enter from the other side, PANDARUS.  Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame
Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!
[Exit."
788,par.,PARIS,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-par.," Else might the world convince of levity 
As well my undertakings as your counsels:
But I attest the gods, your full consent
Gave wings to my propension and cut off
All fears attending on so dire a project.
For what, alas, can these my single arms?
What propugnation is in one man's valor,
To stand the push and enmity of those
This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
Were I alone to pass the difficulties
And had as ample power as I have will, 
Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
Nor faint in the pursuit. Sir, I propose not merely to myself
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
But I would have the soil of her fair rape
Wiped off, in honorable keeping her.
What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me, 
Now to deliver her possession up
On terms of base compulsion!   Can it be
That so degenerate a strain as this
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
There's not the meanest spirit on our party
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
Where Helen is the subject: then, I say, 
Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
The world's large spaces cannot parallel.           They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall, 
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector. Sweet, above thought I love thee. [Exeunt. See, ho! who is that there? A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--
Witness the process of your speech, wherein
You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
Did haunt you in the field. This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
What business, lord, so early? His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:
Let's have your company, or, if you please,
Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge-- 
My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
Rouse him and give him note of our approach,
With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
We shall be much unwelcome. There is no help;
The bitter disposition of the time
Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you. And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,
Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,
Myself or Menelaus? You are too bitter to your countrywoman. Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
But we in silence hold this virtue well,
We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
Here lies our way.
[Exeunt. It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
Tell you the lady what she is to do,
And haste her to the purpose. I know what 'tis to love;             
And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
Please you walk in, my lords.
[Exeunt.  [Within] Brother Troilus! Hark!   Hector's trumpet. 'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.

Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day! In all swift haste. Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you? May one, that is a herald and a prince,
Do a fair message to his kingly ears? Fair leave and large security. How may
A stranger to those most imperial looks
Know them from eyes of other mortals? Ay;I ask, that I might waken reverence,
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
Modest as the morning when she coldly eyes
The youthful Phoebus:                     
Which is that god in office, guiding men?
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon? Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and, Jove's accord,
Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
But what the repining enemy commends,
That breath fame blows; that praise, sole pure, transcends. Ay, Greek, that is my name. Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears. Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him: 
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
To set his sense on the attentive bent,
And then to speak. Trumpet, blow loud,
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.                
[Trumpet sounds.
We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy 
A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
Who in this dull and long-continued truce
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
That holds his honor higher than his ease,
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
That knows his valor, and knows not his fear,
That loves his mistress more than in confession,
With truant vows to her own lips he loves, 
And dare avow her beauty and her worth
In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
If any come, Hector shall honor him;   
If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
The splinter of a lance. Even so much. Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth! Is the prince there in person?
Had I so good occasion to lie long
As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
Should rob my bed-mate of my company. Health to you, valiant sir, 
During all question of the gentle truce;
But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
As heart can think or courage execute. And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
With his face backward. In humane gentleness, 
Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
No man alive can love in such a sort
The thing he means to kill more excellently. We know each other well.          I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not. That I assure you:
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Than Cressid borne from Troy. Good morrow, all.                                             
[Exit with Servant. Good morrow, lord, good morrow. Is not Prince Troilus here? Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
It doth import him much to speak with me.  My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
My matter is so rash: there is at hand
Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
We must give up to Diomedes' hand
The Lady Cressida. By Priam and the general state of Troy:
They are at hand and ready to effect it.  Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature
Have not more gift in taciturnity.                    
[Exeunt Troilus and AEneas.
 [Within] My lord, is the lady ready? [Within] Nay, good my lord,-- How have we spent this morning!
The prince must think me tardy and remiss,
That swore to ride before him to the field. Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,
Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie 
On his fair worth and single chivalry.                              
[Exeunt.  Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
A victor shall be known? will you the knights
Shall to the edge of all extremity
Pursue each other, or shall be divided
By any voice or order of the field,         Hector bade ask. He cares not; he'll obey conditions. If not Achilles, sir,What is your name? Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:
In the extremity of great and little,
Valor and pride excel themselves in Hector;
The one almost as infinite as all,            
The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek. Princes, enough, so please you, There is expectance here from both the sides,
What further you will do. The noble Menelaus. 'Tis the old Nestor. I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:
Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home. Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:
Never go home; here starve we out the night.
                Enter TROILUS. My lord, you do discomfort all the host. "
793,cal.,CALCHAS,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-cal.," Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
From certain and possess'd conveniences,
To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
And here, to do you service, am become
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
To give me now a little benefit,
Out of those many register'd in promise,
Which, you say, live to come in my behalf. You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
That their negotiations all must slack,
Wanting his manage; and they will almost
Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
In most accepted pain. [Within] Who calls? [Within] She comes to you.
Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES, at a distance; after them, THERSITES."

      For, O, love's bow
      Shoots buck and doe:
      The shaft confounds,      Not that it wounds, 
But tickles still the sore. 
These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!
Yet that which seems the wound to kill,
Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!  
      So dying love lives still:
 Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
 Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!Heigh-ho!               Pretty, i' faith. Leave! an you take leave till tomorrow morning,--                             [Within] What, 's all the doors open here?     Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,I knew you not: what news with you so early? Here! what should he do here?             Here, here, here he comes.

Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;
And being once subdued in armed tail,
Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted cloths. 
As many as be here of pander's hall,
Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;
Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
It should be now, but that my fear is this,
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:
Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,
And at that time bequeath you my diseases.
[Exit."
795,agam.,AGAMEMNON,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-agam.," Princes,
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
The ample proposition that hope makes
In all designs begun on earth below
Fails in the promised largeness: checks and disasters
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
As knots by the conflux of meeting sap,
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
Nor, princes, is it matter new to us           
That we come short of our suppose so far
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
Sith every action that hath gone before,
Whereof we have record, trial did draw
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
And that unbodied figure of the thought
That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
Do you with cheeks abashed behold our works,
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
But the protractive trials of great Jove      
To find persistive constancy in men:
The fineness of which metal is not found
In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
The wise and the fool, the artist and unread,
The hard and soft, seem all affined and kin:
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
And what hath mass or matter, by itself
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.          Speak, Prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect 
That matter needless, of importless burden,
Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
We shall hear music, wit and oracle. The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses, 
What is the remedy? What trumpet? look, Menelaus. What would you 'fore our tent? Even this. With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
Call Agamemnon head and general. How! This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
Are ceremonious courtiers. Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas? What's your affair, I pray you? He hears nought privately that comes from Troy. Speak frankly as the wind;
It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,
He tells thee so himself. This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;
If none of them have soul in such a kind,
We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
That means not, hath not, or is not in lovely
If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he. Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
Achilles shall have word of this intent;
So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
Yourself shall feast with us before you go
And find the welcome of a noble foe.           
[Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor. Where is Achilles? Let it be known to him that we are here.
He shent our messengers; and we lay by
Our appertainments, visiting of him:
Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
We dare not move the question of our place,
Or know not what we are. Hear you, Patroclus:
We are too well acquainted with these answers:
But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him, 
We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,
If you do say we think him over-proud
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
Than in the note of judgement; and worthier than himself
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
Disguise the holy strength of their command,
And underwrite in an observing kind
His humorous predominance; yea, watch
His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if 
The passage and whole carriage of this action
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
That if he overhold his price so much,
We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine
Not portable, lie under this report:
'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so. In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
[Exit Ulysses.      What's his excuse? Why will he not upon our fair request
Untent his person and share the air with us? Let Ajax go to him.
Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
At your request a little from himself. O, no, you shall not go.  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
[Exeunt.  What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand. Let Diomedes bear him, 
And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready. We'll execute your purpose, and put on 
A form of strangeness as we pass along:
So do each lord, and either greet him not,
Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way. What says Achilles? would he aught with us? The better.            
[Exeunt Agamemnon and Nestor. Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
Anticipating time with starting courage.
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air
May pierce the head of the great combatant
And hale him thither. Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter? Is this the Lady Cressid? Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady. Yonder comes the troop.
Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS,
and other Trojans, with Attendants. Which way would Hector have it? Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
Consent upon the order of their fight,      
So be it; either to the uttermost,
Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
[Ajax and Hector enter the lists.  What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy? The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd;
His heart and hand both open and both free;
For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows; 
Yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty,
Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;
Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
To tender objects, but he in heat of action
Is more vindicative than jealous love:
They call him Troilus, and on him erect
A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
Even to his inches, and with private soul 
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.            
[Alarum.   Hector and Ajax fight. They are in action. His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax! Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
That would be rid of such an enemy;
But that's no welcome: understand more clear.
What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
And formless ruin of oblivion;
But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
Bids thee, with most divine integrity,       
From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome. [To Troilus] My well-famed lord of Troy, no less to you. First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
There in the full convive we: afterwards,
As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
Concur together, severally entreat him.
Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
That this great soldier may his welcome know.        
Exeunt all except Troilus and Ulysses.  We go wrong, we go wrong. So now, fair Prince of Troy, I bid good night.
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you. Good night.          
[Exeunt Agamemnon and Menelaus.  Renew, renew!   The fierce Polydamas
Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
Hath Doreus prisoner,
And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
Upon the pashed corses of the kings          
Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,
Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes
Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary
Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,
To reinforcement, or we perish all.
                 Enter NESTOR. Hark! hark! what shout is that? March patiently along: let one be sent
To pray Achilles to see us at our tent.

I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.  An odd man, lady! every man is odd. You fillip me o' the head. Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:

797,achil.,ACHILLES,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-achil.,"                Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:
That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.        What, comes the general to speak with me?
You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy. No. Good day, good day. What, does the cuckold scorn me? Good morrow, Ajax. Good morrow. What mean these fellows?   Know they not Achilles?  What, am I poor of late?
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
And not a man, for being simply man,   
Hath any honor, but honor for those honors
That are without him, as place, riches, favor,
Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
To love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
Do one pluck down another and together
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
At ample point all that I did possess,
Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out 
Something not worth in me such rich beholding
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses:
I'll interrupt his reading.How now, Ulysses! What are you reading? This is not strange, Ulysses.
The beauty that is borne here in the face
The bearer knows not, but commends itselfTo others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
Salutes each other with each other's form;
For speculation turns not to itself,
Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there 
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all. I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot? Of this my privacy 
I have strong reasons. Ha! known! Shall Ajax fight with Hector? I see my reputation is at stake;
My fame is shrewdly gored. Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
An appetite that I am sick withal,
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
To talk with him and to behold his visage, 
Even to my full of view.
               Enter THERSITES.A labor saved!        My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
And I myself see not the bottom of it.             
[Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus. 'Tis but early days. I'll take that winter from your lips, fair lady:
Achilles bids you welcome. 'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
The knight opposed. If not Achilles, nothing. A maiden battle, then?   O, I perceive you.
              Re-enter DIOMEDES. I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou! 
Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
And quoted joint by joint. I am Achilles. Behold thy fill. Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb. Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
That I may give the local wound a name
And make distinct the very breach whereout
Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens! I tell thee, yea. Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
To-night all friends. I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night
Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.
Patroclus, let us feast him to the height. How now, thou core of envy!
Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?  My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:
Fall Greeks; fail fame; honor or go or stay;
My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:
This night in banqueting must all be spent. 
Away, Patroclus!               
[Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus.  Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all. Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
That go or tarry. Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,
Keep Hector company an hour or two. Come, come, enter my tent.
[Exeunt Achilles, Hector, Ajax, and Nestor.  Where is this Hector?
Come, come, thou boy queller, show thy face;
Know what it is to meet Achilles angry:
Hector! where's Hector? I will none but Hector.
[Exeunt. 
 Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector! I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:
Be happy that my arms are out of use:
My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
Till when, go seek thy fortune.
[Exit. Come here about me, you my Myrmidons;
Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:
Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:
And when I have the bloody Hector found,
Empale him with your weapons round about;
In fellest manner execute your aims.
Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:
It is decreed Hector the great must die.                       
Exeunt.
Enter MENELAUS, and PARIS, fighting: then THERSITES. Look, Hector, how the sun begins to net;
How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
Even with the vail and darking of the sun,
To close the day up, Hector's life is done. Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.              
[Hector falls. 
So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!
Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'                       
[A retreat sounded.
Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part. The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,
And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,
Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.                     
[Sheathes his sword.
Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;      
Along the field I will the Trojan trail.  
[Exeunt.

An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:Let me go to him.       A whoreson dog, that shall palter thus with us!Would he were a Trojan! Shall I call you father? How now, Patroclus! Ha? Ay, and good next day too.
[Exit. Thou, trumpet, there's my purse,
Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:
Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood; 
Thou blow'st for Hector.
[Trumpet sounds. I am not warm yet; let us fight again. I thank thee, Hector:
Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence 
A great addition earned in thy death. If I might in entreaties find success--
As seld I have the chance--I would desire 
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents. Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here. Do not chafe thee, cousin: 
And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
You may have every day enough of Hector,
If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him. No, yonder 'tis;There, where we see the lights. No, not a whit.
 Troilus! thou coward Troilus!
[Exit. Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!
                Enter DIOMEDES. What wouldst thou? Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!
                 Enter TROILUS. I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.  If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
Great Hector was a man as good as he."
799,ulyss.,ULYSSES,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-ulyss.," Agamemnon,
Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit,
In whom the tempers and the minds of all
Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
Besides the applause and approbation
To which, [To Agamemnon] most mighty for thy place and sway,
[To Nestor] And thou most reverent for thy stretch'd-out life
I give to both your speeches, which were such
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
Should hold up high in brass, and such again
As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
Should with a bond of air, strong as the axletree
On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears 
To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak. Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
But for these instances.
The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
When that the general is not like the hive 
To whom the foragers shall all repair,
What honey is expected?   Degree being vizarded,
The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
Observe degree, priority and place,
Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
Office and custom, in all line of order;
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered 
Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
And posts, like the commandment of a king,
Sans check to good and bad: but when the planets
In evil mixture to disorder wander,
What plagues and what portents!   what mutiny!
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
The unity and married calm of states   
Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is shaked,
Which is the ladder of all high designs,
The enterprise is sick! How could communities,
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
The primogenitive and due of birth,
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
But by degree, stand in authentic place?
Take but degree away, untune that string,
And, hark what discord follows! each thing meets 
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
And make a sop of all this solid globe:
Strength should be lord of imbecility,
And the rude son should strike his father dead:
Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
Between whose endless jar justice resides,
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
Then every thing includes itself in power,
Power into will, will into appetite;         
And appetite, an universal wolf,
So doubly seconded with will and power,
Must make perforce an universal prey,
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
Follows the choking.
And this neglection of degree it is
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
By him one step below, he by the next, 
That next by him beneath; so every step,
Exampled by the first pace that is sick
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
Of pale and bloodless emulation:
And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
Not her own sinews.   To end a tale of length,
Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength. The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
The sinew and the forehand of our host,
Having his ear full of his airy fame,
Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
Breaks scurril jests;
And with ridiculous and awkward action,
Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,       
He pageants us.   Sometime, great Agamemnon,
Thy topless deputation he puts on,
And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--
Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,
'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd, 
Would seem hyperboles.   At this fusty stuff
The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
As he being drest to some oration.'
That's done, as near as the extremest ends
Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
'Tis Nestor right.   Now play him me, Patroclus,
Arming to answer in a night alarm.'       
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
Sir Valor dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
Or give me ribs of steel!   I shall split all
In pleasure of my spleen.'   And in this fashion,
All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
Severals and generals of grace exact,        
Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes. They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
Count wisdom as no member of the war,
Forestall prescience and esteem no act 
But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--
Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;
So that the ram that batters down the wall,
For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
They place before his hand that made the engine,
Or those that with the fineness of their souls
By reason guide his execution.            Amen. Nestor!                             I have a young conception in my brain;
Be you my time to bring it to some shape. This 'tis:
Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
That hath to this maturity blown up
In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,
Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
To overbulk us all. This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
However it is spread in general name,
Relates in purpose only to Achilles. And wake him to the answer, think you? Give pardon to my speech:
Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,
And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not, 
The lustre of the better yet to show,
Shall show the better. Do not consent
That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
For both our honor and our shame in this
Are dogg'd with two strange followers. What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
Were he not proud, we all should share with him:
But he already is too insolent;
And we were better parch in Afric sun    
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,
Why then, we did our main opinion crush
In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;
And by device, let blockish Ajax draw
The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
Give him allowance for the better man;
For that will physic the great Myrmidon
Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
Yet go we under our opinion still
That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes. We saw him at the opening of his tent: 
He is not sick.      Achilles will not to the field tomorrow. He doth rely on none,
But carries on the stream of his dispose
Without observance or respect of any,
In will peculiar and in self-admission. Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,
He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness, 
And speaks not to himself but with a pride
That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
And batters down himself: what should I say?
He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
Cry 'No recovery.' O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
And never suffers matter of the world
Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd
Of that we hold an idol more than he?     
No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;
Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
As amply titled as Achilles is,By going to Achilles:
That were to enlard his fat already pride
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
With entertaining great Hyperion.
This lord go to him!   Jupiter forbid,
And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.' Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.     Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
Here is a man--but 'tis before his face; 
I will be silent. Know the whole world, he is as valiant. If he were proud,-- Ay, or surly borne,-- Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;
Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:
Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:
But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,
Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
And give him half: and, for thy vigor,
Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines
Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;
Instructed by the antiquary times,
He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:
But pardon, father Nestor, were your days
As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,
You should not have the eminence of him,
But be as Ajax. There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
Keeps thicket. Please it our great general 
To call together all his state of war;
Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow
We must with all our main of power stand fast:
And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,
And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best. Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
As if he were forgot; and, princes all,   
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
If so, I have derision medicinable,
To use between your strangeness and his pride,
Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
It may do good: pride hath no other glass
To show itself but pride, for supple knees
Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees. Now, great Thetis' son! A strange fellow here
Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
How much in having, or without or in,
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection:
As when his virtues shining upon others   
Heat them and they retort that heat again
To the first giver.' I do not strain at the position,--
It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;
Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
That no man is the lord of any thing,
Though in and of him there be much consisting,
Till he communicate his parts to others;
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
Till he behold them form'd in the applause
Where they're extended; who, like an arch, reverberates 
The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;
And apprehended here immediately
The unknown Ajax.
Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
Most abject in regard and dear in use!
What things again most dear in the esteem
And poor in worth!   Now shall we see tomorrow-- 
An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
While some men leave to do!
How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
While others play the idiots in her eyes!
How one man eats into another's pride,
While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
And great Troy shrieking. Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,     
Keeps honor bright: to have done is to hang
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
In monumental mockery.   Take the instant way;
For honor travels in a strait so narrow,
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
For emulation hath a thousand sons
That one by one pursue: if you give way,
Or hedge aside from   the direct forthright,
Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
And leave you hindmost;                    
Or, like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
For time is like a fashionable host
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
And farewell goes out sighing.   O, let not virtue seek
Remuneration for the thing it was;        For beauty, wit,
High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
To envious and calumniating time.
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
Though they are made and moulded of things past,
And give to dust that is a little gilt
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
The present eye praises the present object:
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
And still it might, and yet it may again,
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
And case thy reputation in thy tent;
Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
And drave great Mars to faction. But 'gainst your privacy
The reasons are more potent and heroical:
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
With one of Priam's daughters. Is that a wonder?
The providence that's in a watchful state
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles. 
There is a mystery--with whom relation
Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
Which hath an operation more divine
Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
And better would it fit Achilles much
To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
When fame shall in our islands sound her trump, 
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
Farwell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
[Exit.  No trumpet answers. 'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;
He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
 Enter DIOMEDES with CRESSIDA. Yet is the kindness but particular;'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.  O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns! 
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns. It were no match, your nail against his horn.
May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you? I do desire it. Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss.
When Helen is a maid again, and his.        Never's my day, and then a kiss of you. Fie, fie upon her!
There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
At every joint and motive of her body.
O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
That give accosting welcome ere it comes,
And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
To every ticklish reader! set them down 
For sluttish spoils of opportunity
And daughters of the game.

[Trumpet within. They are opposed already. I wonder now how yonder city stands
When we have her base and pillar by us. Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:
My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds, 
Must kiss their own feet. So to him we leave it.
Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:
After the general, I beseech you next
To feast with me and see me at my tent. At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:
There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;
Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
On the fair Cressid. You shall command me, sir,
As gentle tell me, of what honor was
This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
That wails her absence? Here comes himself to guide you.
              Re-enter ACHILLES. [Aside to Troilus] Follow his torch; he goes to Calchas' tent:
I'll keep you company. Stand where the torch may not discover us.
                Enter CRESSIDA. She will sing any man at first sight. List. How now, Trojan?                 You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,
Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;
The time right deadly; I beseech you, go. Nay, good my lord, go off:
You flow to great distraction; come, my lord. You have not patience; come. Why, how now, lord! You shake, my lord, at something: will you go? 
You will break out. Come, come. You have sworn patience. My lord,-- All's done, my lord. Why stay we, then? I cannot conjure, Trojan. Most sure she was. Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now. What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers? May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
With that which here his passion doth express? O, contain yourself;   
Your passion draw ears hither.
                 Enter AENEAS. I'll bring you to the gates. O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles 
Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance:
Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,
Together with his mangled Myrmidons,
That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,
Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend
And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
Mad and fantastic execution,
Engaging and redeeming of himself
With such a careless force and forceless care
As if that luck, in every spite of cunning,Bade him win all.
                   Enter AJAX."
800,nest.,NESTOR,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-nest.," With due observance of thy godlike seat,
Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
Thy latest words.   In the reproof of chance
Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
How many shallow bauble boasts dare sail
Upon her patient breast, making their way
With those of nobler bulk!
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut, 
Bounding between the two moist elements,
Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
Co-rivall'd greatness?   Either to harbor fled,
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
Doth valor's show and valor's worth divide
In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks, 
And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
As roused with rage doth sympathize,
And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
Retorts to chiding fortune. Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
The fever whereof all our power is sick. And in the imitation of these twain--
Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
With an imperial voice--many are infect.
Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
In such a rein, in full as proud a place
As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him; 
Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
To match us in comparisons with dirt,
To weaken and discredit our exposure,
How rank soever rounded in with danger. Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
Makes many Thetis' sons.
[A tucket.  Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man 
When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
But if there be not in our Grecian host
One noble man that hath one spark of fire,
To answer for his love, tell him from me
I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
And meeting him will tell him that my lady
Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood. What says Ulysses? What is't? Well, and how?          The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,
Whose grossness little characters sum up:
And, in the publication, make no strain,
But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,
'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgement,
Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose   
Pointing on him. Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
That can from Hector bring his honor off,
If not Achilles?   Though't be a sportful combat,
Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
Our imputation shall be oddly poised
In this wild action; for the success,        
Although particular, shall give a scantling
Of good or bad unto the general;
And in such indexes, although small pricks
To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
The baby figure of the giant mass
Of things to come at large.   It is supposed
He that meets Hector issues from our choice;
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
As 'twere from forth us all, a man distill'd 
Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
In no less working than are swords and bows
Directive by the limbs. I see them not with my old eyes: what are they? Ulysses,Now I begin to relish thy advice;
And I will give a taste of it forthwith
To Agamemnon: go we to him straight. 
Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.
[Exeunt.       Yet he loves himself:   is't not strange?

                Re-enter ULYSSES. [Aside to Dio.] O, this is well; he rubs the vein of him.      Wherefore should you so?
He is not emulous, as Achilles is. What a vice were it in Ajax now,-- Ay, my good son. Would you, my lord, aught with the general? Nothing, my lord.                   Our general doth salute you with a kiss. And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.So much for Nestor. A woman of quick sense. How, Ajax, hold thine own! I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
Laboring for destiny make cruel way
Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
Despising many forfeits and subduements,
When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
Not letting it decline on the declined,
That I have said to some my standers by 
'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;
But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
Never like thee.   Let an old man embrace thee;
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.  I would my arms could match thee in contention,
As they contend with thee in courtesy. Ha!By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee tomorrow.
Well, welcome, welcome!--I have seen the time.  Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles;
And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
There is a thousand Hectors in the field:
Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,   
And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:
Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,
Dexterity so obeying appetite
That what he will he does, and does so much
That proof is call'd impossibility.
                 Enter ULYSSES. So, so, we draw together.
                Enter ACHILLES. Peace, drums!
[Within] Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles!"
801,dio.,DIOMEDES,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-dio.," [Aside to Nest.] And how his silence drinks up this applause!  Or covetous of praise,-- Or strange, or self-affected!        Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax. This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
Which I am proud to bear.              
[Exeunt Diomedes and Calchas.
   Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent.  That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas. The one and other Diomed embraces.
Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health
But when contention and occasion meet,
By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
With all my force, pursuit and policy. We sympathise: Jove, let AEneas live,
If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
But, in mine emulous honor, let him die,
With every joint a wound, and that tomorrow! We do; and long to know each other worse. Both alike:
He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,
Not making any scruple of her soilure,
With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
And you as well to keep her, that defend her,
Not palating the taste of her dishonor,
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up 
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;
But he as he, the heavier for a whore. She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:
For every false drop in her bawdy veins
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
Of her contaminated carrion weight,       
A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,
She hath not given so many good words breath
As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death. Fair Lady Cressid,
So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed   
You shall be mistress, and command him wholly. O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:
Let me be privileged by my place and message,
To be a speaker free; when I am hence,
I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,
I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'
I'll speak it in my spirit and honor, 'no.' Even she. Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.
[Exit with Cressida.  You must no more.
[Trumpets cease.  As Hector pleases. 'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector. I cannot, lord; I have important business,
The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.  What, are you up here, ho? speak. Diomed. Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter? How now, my charge! Will you remember? Nay, but do, then;And let your mind be coupled with your words. Nay, then,--                         Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn. What did you swear you would bestow on me? Good night. No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more. And so, good night. Foh, foh! adieu; you palter. But will you, then? Give me some token for the surety of it.  Whose was't?                        I shall have it. Ay, that. I had your heart before, this follows it. I will have this: whose was it? Come, tell me whose it was. Whose was it?    To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it. Why, then, farewell;
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again. I do not like this fooling. What, shall I come? the hour? Farewell till then. Thou dost miscall retire:
I do not fly, but advantageous care
Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:
Have at thee! Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:
Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;
Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,
And am her knight by proof. Serv.                    I go, my lord.
[Exit.
              Enter AGAMEMNON. Ay, there, there. Troilus, I say! where's Troilus? I would correct him. Ha, art thou there? He is my prize; I will not look upon. The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles."

[Exit.  Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,
If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
Did move your greatness and this noble state
To call upon him; he hopes it is no other 
But for your health and your digestion sake,
An after-dinner's breath. I shall; and bring his answer presently.
[Exit.  They pass by strangely; they were used to bend,
To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
To come as humbly as they used to creepTo holy altars. To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:
A woman impudent and mannish grown
Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this:
They think my little stomach to the war 
And your great love to me restrains you thus:
Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
Be shook to air. Ay, and perhaps receive much honor by him. O, then, beware;
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
Omission to do what is necessary           
Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
Even then when we sit idly in the sun.         But that's no argument for kissing now;
For thus popp'd Paris in his hardiment,And parted thus you and your argument. The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:
Patroclus kisses you. Paris and I kiss evermore for him. Both take and give. Here comes Thersites.
               Enter THERSITES.      "

A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.  Now the pledge; now, now, now! Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!  A proof of strength she could not publish more,

Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
He chid Andromache and struck his armorer,
And, like as there was husbandry in war,
Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
And to the field goes he; where every flower
Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw     
In Hector's wrath. The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
They call him Ajax. They say he is a very man per se,And stands alone.    "
831,duke.,SOLINUS,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-duke.,"  Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
Why thou departed'st from thy native home
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus,

 Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.

 And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
Do me the favor to dilate at full
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.

 Hapless Ægeon, whom the fates have mark'd
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
But, though thou art adjudged to the death
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
But to our honor's great disparagement,
Yet I will favor thee in what I can.
Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
To seek thy life by beneficial help:
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die
Gaoler, take him to thy custody.

 Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
If any friend will pay the sum for him,m
He shall not die; so much we tender him.

 She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

 Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
To do him all the grace and good I could.
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
And bid the lady abbess come to me.
I will determine this before I stir.
                Enter a Servant.
 Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard and halberds!

 Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

 A grievous fault!  Say, woman, didst thou so?

 But had he such a chain of thee or no?

 Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
If here you housed him, here he would have been;
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?

 Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here ?

 Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
I think you are all mated or stark mad.
[Exit one to the Abbess.
 Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.

 I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
Have I been patron to Antipholus,
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
Re-enter Abbess, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse. 
 One of these men is Genius to the other;
And so of these. Which is the natural man,
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?

 Why, here begins his morning story right:
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
These are the parents to these children,
Which accidentally are met together.
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?

 Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.

 It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

 With all my heart I'll gossip at this feast.
[Exeunt all but Ant. S., Ant. E., Dro. S., and Dro. E.

"
832,aege.,GEON,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-aege.,"  Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

 A heavier task could not have been imposed
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself, almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
There had she not been long but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
And, which was strange, the one so like the other
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
A meaner woman was delivered
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Made daily motions for our home return:
Unwilling I agreed; alas! too soon,
We came aboard.
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
Before the always wind-obeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
But longer did we not retain much hope;
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
To him one of the other twins was bound,
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dispersed those vapors that offended us;
And, by the benefit of his wished light,
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
Two ships from far making amain to us,
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.

 O, had the gods done so, I had not now
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
We were encounter'd by a mighty rock;
Which being violently borne upon,
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
Was carried with more speed before the wind;
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
At length, another ship had seized on us;
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

 My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
At eighteen years became inquisitive
After his brother: and importuned me
That his attendant--so his case was like,
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
Might bear him company in the quest of him:
Whom whilst I labor'd of a love to see,
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
Or that or any place that harbors men.
But here must end the story of my life;
And happy were I in my timely death,
Could all my travels warrant me they live.

 Hopeless and helpless doth Ægeon wend,
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
[Exeunt. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.

 Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
Haply I see a friend will save my life
And pay the sum that may deliver me.

 Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus ?
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?

 I am sure you both of you remember me.

 Why look you strange on me? you know me well.

 O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
And careful hours with time's deformed hand
Have written strange defeatures in my face:
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?

 Dromio, nor thou?

 I am sure thou dost.

 Not know my voice!   O time's extremity,
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
In seven short years, that here my only son
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
Yet hath my night of life some memory,
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus,

 But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.

 If I dream not, thou art Æmilia:
If thou art she, tell me where is that son
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

"
833,ant.-e.,ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-ant.-e.," Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet,
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
But here's a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart and that I beat him,
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

 I think thou art an ass.

 You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.

 O, Signior Balthazer, either at flesh or fish,
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.

 And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

 Ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest:
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.

 Who talks within there? ho, open the door!

 Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.

 What are thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?

 Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?

 Thou baggage, let me in.

 You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.

 Are you there, wife? you might have come before.

 There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.

 Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.

 Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.

 Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.

 You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
I know a wench of excellent discourse,
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
To her will we to dinner.   [To Ang.]
Get you home
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

 Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
[Exeunt.  While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
Among my wife and her confederates,
For locking me out of my doors by day.
But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.

 A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
I promised your presence and the chain;
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
Belike you thought our love would last too long,
If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.

 I am not furnish'd with the present money;
Besides, I have some business in the town.
Good signior, take the stranger to my house
And with you take the chain and bid my wife
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

 No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.

 An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
Or else you may return without your money.

 Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
I should have chid you for not bringing it,
But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.

 Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.

 Fie, now you run this humor out of breath,
Come, where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.

 I answer you! what should I answer you?

 I owe you none till I receive the chain.

 You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.

 Consent to pay thee that I never had!
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.

 I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
As all the metal in your shop will answer.

 How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?

 Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
And told thee to what purpose and what end.

 I will debate this matter at more leisure
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:
Tell her I am arrested in the street
And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!
On, officer, to prison till it come.
[Exeunt Sec. Merchant, Angelo,Officer, and Ant. E.
 Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
And will not lightly trust the messenger.
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end.
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?

  Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?

 To what end did I bid thee hie thee home ?

    Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
Enter   ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH.
  There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.[Striking him. 
 Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.

 You minion, you, are these your customers?
Did this companion with the saffron face
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
And I denied to enter in my house?

 Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?

 Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?

 And did not she herself revile me there ?

 Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?

 And did not I in rage depart from thence ?

 Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.

 Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?

 Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?

 Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
And art confederate with a damned pack
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
That would behold in me this shameful sport.
Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives.
 What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer themTo make a rescue?

 O most unhappy strumpet!

 Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?

 Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!
Even for the service that long since I did thee,
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

 Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
That hath abused and dishonor'd me
Even in the strength and height of injury!
Beyond imagination is the wrong
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

 This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
While she with harlots feasted in my house.

 My liege, I am advised what I say,
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
Could witness it, for he was with me then;
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
I went to seek him: in the street I meet him
And in his company that gentleman.
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
That I this day of him received the chain,
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
He did arrest me with an officer.
I did obey, and sent my peasant home
For certain ducats: he with none return'd
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house.
By the way we met
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
Of vile confederates. Along with them
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler and a forutne-teller,
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
A living-dead man: this pernicious slave,
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man, both bound together;
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
I gain'd my freedom and immediately
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities.

 I never came within these abbeywalls,
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
And this is false you burden me withal.

 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.

 I never saw you in my life till now.

 Neither.

 I never saw my father in my life.

 The duke and all that know me in the city
Can witness with me that it is not so:
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.

 I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--

 Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

 No; I say nay to that.

 And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.

 These ducats pawn I for my father here.

 There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

 Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?

"
834,ant.-s.,ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-ant.-s.," Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.

 A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humor with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town,
And then go to my inn and dine with me?

 Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.

 He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
          Enter DROMIO of Ephesus.
Here comes the almanac of my true date.
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon ?

 Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?

 I am not in a sportive humor now:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?

 Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

 Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge,

 Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

 Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?

 What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

 Upon my life, by some device or other
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage,
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
And many such-like liberties of sin:
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
I greatly fear my money is not safe.
[Exit. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
By computation and mine host's report.
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mark. See, here he comes.
         Enter DROMIO of Syracuse.
How now, sir! is your merry humor alter'd?
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

 Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

 Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.

 Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?
Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
[Beating him. 
 Because that I familiarly sometimes
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
Your sauciness will jest upon my love
And make a common of my serious hours.
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
If you will jest with me, know my aspect
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

  Shall I tell you why?

 Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore,--
For urging it the second time to me.

    Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

               I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?
         Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA.
 Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
As strange unto your town as to your talk;
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
Want wit in all one word to understand.

 By Dromio?

 Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman ?
What is the course and drift of your compact?

 Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

 How can she thus then call us by our names?
Unless it be by inspiration.

 To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
What, was I married to her in my dream?
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Until I know this sure uncertainty,
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

 I think thou art in mind, and so am I.

 Thou hast thine own form.

 Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
I'll say as they say and persever so,
And in this mist at all adventures go.

 Sweet mistress,--what your name is else, I know not,
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
Lay open to my earthly-gross conceit,
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
Against my soul's pure truth why labor you
To make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god? would you create me new?
Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
But if that I am I, then well I know
vYour weeping sister is no wife of mine,
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe:
Far more, far more to you do I decline.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die:
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink !

 Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.

 For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.

 As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.

 Thy sister's sister.

 No;
It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.

 Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
Give me thy hand.

                  Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
I will not harbor in this town to-night:
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
Where I will walk till thou return to me.
If every one knows us and we know none,
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.

 There's none but witches do inhabit here;
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
She that doth call me husband, even my soul
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
          Enter ANGELO with the chain.
 Ay, that's my name.

 What is your will that I shall do with this?

 Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.

 I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.

 What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
But this I think, there's no man is so vain
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
I'll to the mart and there for Dromio stay:
If any ship put out, then straight away.
[Exit. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
And every one doth call me by my name.
Some tender money to me; some invite me;
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
Some offer me commodities to buy:
Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me
And therewithal took measure of my body.
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
          Enter DROMIO of Syracuse.
 What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?

    The fellow is distract, and so am I;
And here we wander in illusions:
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
              Enter a Courtezan.
 Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.

 It is the devil.

  Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.

 Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.

 I see these witches are afraid of swords.

 Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.

 I will not stay to-night for all the town;
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
[Exeunt. I think I had; I never did deny it.

 Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

 Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
I'll prove mine honor and mine honesty
Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.

 Ægeon art thou not? or else his ghost?

 No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.

 I, gentle mistress.

 And so do I; yet did she call me so:
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
Did call me brother. [To Luc.What I told you then,
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
If this be not a dream I see and hear.

 I think it be, sir; I deny it not.

 This purse of ducats I received from you,
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
I see we still did meet each other's man,
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.

 He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:
Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
[Exeunt Ant. S. and Ant. E.
"
835,dro.-e.,DROMIO of Ephsus,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-dro.-e.," Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to-day.

 O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.

 I pray you, jest, sir, as you sit at dinner:
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock
And strike you home without a messenger.

 To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.

 My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
My mistress and her sister stays for you.

 I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again,
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

 Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.

 What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
[Exit.
  Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

  Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

 I mean not cuckold-mad;
But, sure, he is stark mad.
When I desired him to come home to dinner,
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he,
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he;
'My mistress, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'

 Quoth my master:
'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

 Go back again, and be new beaten home?
For God's sake, send some other messenger.

 And he will bless that cross with other beating:
Between you I shall have a holy head.

 Am I so round with you as you with me,
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
[Exit. 
 Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

 Marry, so it doth appear
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.

 Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!

 What patch is made our porter? My master stays in the street.

 O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a
name or thy name for an ass.

 Let my master in, Luce.

 O Lord, I must laugh!
Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?

 So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.

 Master, knock the door hard.

 If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.

 They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.

 You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.

 A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.

 Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee, let me in.

 A crow without feather?   Master, mean you so?
For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather:
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.

 I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.
[Exit. 
 Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.

 Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.

 I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.

   Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.

    Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.

 Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.

 Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.

 Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.

 In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
That since have felt the vigor of his rage.

 Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
But surely, master, not a rag of money.

 God and the rope-maker bear me witness
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!

 And, gentle master, I received no gold;
But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.

 Master, I am here enter'd in bond for you.

 Will you be bound for nothing?
be mad, good master: cry 'The devil!'

 Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.

 Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.

 Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
For lately we were bound, as you are now
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?

 No, trust me, sir, nor I.

  I, sir, am Dromio: pray, let me stay.

 And I with him.

 No, none by me.

 Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

 That's a question: how shall we try it?

 Nay, then, thus:
We came into the world like brother and brother;
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
[Exeunt. "
836,dro.-s.,DROMIO of Syracuse,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-dro.-s.," Many a man would take you at your word,
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
[Exit.
 What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?

 I did not see you since you sent me hence,
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.

 I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.

 Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
Upon what bargain do you give it me?

    Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?
Well, sir, I thank you.

  No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.

                 By me?

 I, sir? I never saw her till this time.

 I never spake with her in all my life.

 O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
If we obey them not, this will ensue,
They'll suck our breath or pinch us black and blue.

 I am transformed, master, am I not?

 Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.

 No, I am an ape.

 'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
But I should know her as well as she knows me.

 Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

 Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch!
Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store,
When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.

 Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch cold on's feet.

 Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you'll tell me wherefore.

 Nor to-day here you must not; come again when you may.

 The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio.

 If thy name be call'd Luce,--Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.

 And you said no.

 By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly boys.

 Break any breaking here, and I'll break your knave's pate.

 It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon thee, hind!

 Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.

                 And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel,
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' the wheel.

 As from a bear a man would run for life,
So fly I from her that would be my wife.
[Exit.
 Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
 The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitæ.
The ship is in her trim: the merry wind
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
But for their owner, master, and yourself.

 A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.

 You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.

 To Adriana! that is where we dined,
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
Thither I must, although against my will,
For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.
[Exit. Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.

 By running fast.

 No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him:
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.

 I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.

 I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?

 Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
vA chain, a chain!   Do you not hear it ring?

 No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one,

 O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for very fear.

 Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's worth, to season.
Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say,
That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
 Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse. 
      Master, is this Mistress Satan?

    Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.

 'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.
[Exeunt Ant. S. and Dro. S.
 She that would be your wife now ran from you.

  Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!
This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!
[Exeunt Ant. S. and Dro. S. to the Priory.
            Enter the Lady Abbess.
 I, sir, am Dromio: command him away.

 O, my old master! who hath bound him here?

 Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard ?

 Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.

 There is a fat friend at your master's house,
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

 Not I, sir; you are my elder.

 We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.

"
837,bal.,BALTHAZAR,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-bal.," I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.

 Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.

 Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

 In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.

 Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
Herein you war against your reputation
And draw within the compass of suspect
The unviolated honor of your wife,
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
And about evening come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
For slander lives upon succession,
For ever housed where it gets possession.

"
838,ang.,ANGELO,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-ang.," Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either.

 I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.

 Master Antipholus,--

 I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.

 What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.

 Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
Go home with it and please your wife withal;
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
And then receive my money for the chain.

 You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.
[Exit. 
 Even just the sum that I do owe to you
Is growing to me by Antipholus,
And in the instant that I met with you
He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
I shall receive the money for the same.
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's. 
 Saving your merry humor, here's the note
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion,
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
I pray you, see him presently discharged,
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.

 Then you will bring the chain to her yourself ?

 Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?

 Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.

 You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!

 Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
Either send the chain or send me by some token.

 The money that you owe me for the chain.

 You know I gave it you half an hour since.

 You wrong me more, sir, in denying it;
Consider how it stands upon my credit.

 This touches me in reputation.
Either consent to pay this sum for me
Or I attach you by this officer.

 Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
I would not spare my brother in this case,
If he should scorn me so apparently.

 Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.
Enter  DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay.
 I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

 Of very reverend reputation, sir,
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
Second to none that lives here in the city:
His word might bear my wealth at any time.

 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
And, not without some scandal to yourself,
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
This chain which now you wear so openly:
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
Who, but for staying on our controversy,
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?

 I knew he was not in his perfect wits,

 Upon what cause?

 See where they come: we will behold his death.

 O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
In this the madman justly chargeth them.

 My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.

 He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
These people saw the chain about his neck.

 That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

 I think I did, sir; I deny it not.

Is apprehended for arrival here;
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the town,
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
There is your money that I had to keep.

 I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
Please you, I'l meet with you upon the mart

 My business cannot brook this dalliance.
Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
If not, I'll leave him to the officer.

 Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

 How is the man esteemed here in the city ?

 Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse.
 Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

 These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest
To walk where any honest man resort.

 I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
[They draw. 
Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others.
 I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

 By this, I think, the dial points at five:
Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person
Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
The place of death and sorry execution,
Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

 To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
Who put unluckily into this bay
Against the laws and statutes of this town,
Beheaded publicly for his offence.

 Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
Heard you confess you had the chain of him
After you first foreswore it on the mart:
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
And then you fled into this abbey here,
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.

 I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
To yield possession to my holy prayers
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!

 It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
And yielding to him humors well his frenzy.

 Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;

 Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
[They offer to bind Dro. E. 
"
842,abb.,"MILIA, wife to geon",Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-abb.," Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

 How long hath this possession held the man?

 Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
Buried some dear friend?   Hath not else his eye
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

 You should for that have reprehended him.

 Ay, but not rough enough.

 Haply, in private.

 Ay, but not enough.

 And thereof came it that the man was mad:
The venom clamors of a jealous woman
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
And thereof comes it that his head is light.
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
Thou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls:
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
But moody and dull melancholy,
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

 No, not a creature enters in my house.

 Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
And it shall privilege him from your hands
Till I have brought him to his wits again,
Or lose my labor in assaying it.

 Be patient; for I will not let him stir
Till I have used the approved means I have,
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
To make of him a formal man again:
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
A charitable duty of my order.
Therefore depart and leave him here with me,

 Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.
[Exit. 
 Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
[All gather to see them. 
 Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
And gain a husband by his liberty.
Speak, old Ægeon, if thou be'st the man
That hadst a wife once call'd Æmilia
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
O, if thou be'st the same Ægeon, speak,
And speak unto the same Æmilia!

 By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
What then became of them I cannot tell;
I to this fortune that you see me in.

 Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
And all that are assembled in this place,
That by this sympathized one day's error
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
And we shall make full satisfaction.
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
My heavy burthen ne'er delivered.
The duke, my husband and my children both,
And you the calendars of their nativity,
Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
After so long grief, such festivity!

"
843,adr.,ADRIANA,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-adr.," Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

 Why should their liberty than ours be more ?

 Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

 There's none but asses will be bridled so.

 This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

 But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

 How if your husband start some other where?

 Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
They can be meek that have no other cause.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
But were we burden'd with like weight of pain,
As much or more we should ourselves complain:
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me;
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

 Say, is your tardy master now at hand ?

 Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?

  Horn-mad, thou villain!

 Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

 Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

 Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

 His company must do his minions grace,
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
What ruins are in me that can be found,
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair:
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

 Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
Would that alone, alone he would detain,
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
That others touch, and often touching will
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

 Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear,
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
That, undividable, incorporate,
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
And take unmingled thence that drop again,
Without addition or diminishing,
As take from me thyself and not me too.
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
For if we too be one and thou play false,
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
I live unstain'd, thou undishonored.

 By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.

 How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

 Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
To put the finger in the eye and weep,
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.

 Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

 Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?

 Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.

 Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
What observation madest thou in this case
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?

 He meant he did me none; the more my spite.

 And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

 And what said he?

 With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

 Didst speak him fair?

 I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

 Ah, but I think him better than I say,
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
         Enter DROMIO of Syracuse.
 Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?

 Why, man, what is the matter?

 What, is he arrested?   Tell me at whose suit.

 Go fetch it, sister.   Exit Luciana.
This I wonder at,

That he, unknown to me, should be in debt,
Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

 What, the chain?

 The hours come back! that did I never hear.

 As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!

 Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight,
And bring thy master home immediately.
Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
Conceit, my comfort and my injury.
[Exeunt. His incivility confirms no less.
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
Establish him in his true sense again,
And I will please you what you will demand.

 O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!

 O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
Where would you had remain'd until this time,
Free from these slanders and this open shame!

 Is't good to soothe him in these contraries ?

 Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

 He came to me and I deliver'd it.

 I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

 Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.

 O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.

 What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer ?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

 I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

 Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
[Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan.
Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?

 I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

  He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.

 It may be so, but I did never see it.
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
I long to know the truth hereof at large.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier
drawn, and DROMIO of Syracuse. 
 And come with naked swords.
Let's call more help to have them bound again.

 Hold, hurt him not, for God's sakel he is mad.
Some get within him, take his sword away:
Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

 To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
And bear him home for his recovery.

 This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
And much different from the man he was;
But till this afternoon his passion
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

 To none of these, except it be the last;
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

 Why, so I did.

 As roughly as my modesty would let me.

 And in assemblies too.

 It was the copy of our conference:
In bed he slept not for my urging it;
At board he fed not for my urging it;
Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
In company I often glanced it;
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

 She did betray me to my own reproof.
Good people, enter and lay hold on him.

 Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

 I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
And will have no attorney but myself;
And therefore let me have him home with me.

 I will not hence and leave my husband here:
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
To separate the husband and the wife.

 Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
And never rise until my tears and prayers
Have won his grace to come in person hither
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

 Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!

 May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
At your important letters,--this ill day
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
That desperately he hurried through the street,
With him his bondman, all as mad as he,--
Doing displeasure to the citizens
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
That here and there his fury had committed.
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
He broke from those that had the guard of him;
And with his mad attendant and himself,
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
Met us again and madly bent on us,
Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
We came again to bind them. Then they fled
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

 Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
And that is false thou dost report to us.

 Ay me, it is my husband!   Witness you,
That he is borne about invisible:
Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus.
 No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
As this is false he burdens me withal!

 I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

 Which of you two did dine with me to-day ?

 And are not you my husband?

 I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

"
844,luc.,LUCIANA,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-luc.," Perhaps some merchant hath invited him
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
A man is master of his liberty:
Time is their master, and, when they see time,
They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.

 Because their business still lies out o' door.

 O, know he is the bridle of your will.

 Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls
Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
Are masters to their females, and their lords:
Then let your will attend on their accords.

 Not this, but troubles of the marriagebed.

 Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

 Till he come home again, I would forbear.

 Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
           Enter DROMIO of Ephesus.
  Quoth who?

 Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

 Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!

 How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
[Exeunt.  Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
When were you wont to use my sister thus?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.

 Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

 Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

 If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.

 Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
[Exeunt.  And may it be that you have quite forgot
A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
And let her read it in thy looks at board:
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
Being compact of credit, that you love us;
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
We in your motion turn and you may move us.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

 What, are you mad, that you do reason so ?

 It is a fault that springeth from your eye.

 Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.

 Why call you me love? call my sister so.

 That's my sister.

 All this my sister is, or else should be.

 O, soft, sir! hold you still:
I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.
[Exit. 
         Enter DROMIO of Syracuse.
 First he denied you had in him no right.

 Then swore he that he was a stranger here.

 Then pleaded I for you.

 That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.

 With words that in an honest suit might move.
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.

 Have patience, I beseech.

 Who would be jealous then of such a one?
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

 How hast thou lost thy breath?

 Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!

 And I am witness with her that she did.

 Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!

 God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!

 God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.

 She never reprehended him but mildly.
When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?

 Complain unto the duke of this indignity.

 Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.
Enter DUKE, attended; ÆGEON bareheaded;
with the Headsman and other Officers. 
 Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
But she tells to your highness simple truth!

"
845,luce.,LUCE,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-luce.," What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those at the gate?

 Faith, no; he comes too late;And so tell your master.

 Have at you with another; that's--When? can you tell?

 I thought to have asked you.

 Can you tell for whose sake?

 Let him knock till it ache.

 What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?

"
846,cour.,A Courtezan,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-cour.," Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:
Is that the chain you promised me to-day?

 Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
Will you go with me?   We'll mend our dinner here ?

 Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

 I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.

 Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
Else would he never so demean himself.
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
And for the same he promised me a chain:
Both one and other he denies me now.
The reason that I gather he is mad,
Besides this present instance of his rage,
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
On purpose shut the doors against his way.
My way is now to hie home to his house,
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
He rush'd into my house and took perforce
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
For forty ducats is too much to lose.
[Exit. How say you now? is not your husband mad?

 Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!

 When as your husband all in rage to-day
Came to my house and took away my ring--
The ring I saw upon his finger now--
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.

 He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.

 As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.

 Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

"
847,off.,An Officer,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-off.," That labor may you save; see where he comes.

 I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.

 I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.

   Masters, let him go:
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.

 He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
The debt he owes will be required of me.

 One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?

 Two hundred ducats.

 Due for a chain your husband had of him.

 Away! they'll kill us.

"
848,serv.,A Servant,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-serv.," O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
My master and his man are both broke loose,
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor,
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
My master preaches patience to him and the while
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
And sure, unless you send some present help,
Between them they will kill the conjurer.

 Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
[Cry within.
Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress: fly, be gone!

And pay them when you part.
 We are tougher, brother,
Than you can put us to 't.

 One seven-night longer.

 We'll part the time between's then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying.

 Tongue-tied our queen? speak you.

 Well said, Hermione.

 Is he won yet?

 At my request he would not.
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
To better purpose.

 Never, but once.

 Why, that was when
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
'I am yours forever.'

 [Aside] Too hot, too hot!
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
May a free face put on, derive a liberty
From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
As now they are, and making practised smiles,
As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment
My bosom likes not, nor my brows!   Mamillius,
Art thou my boy?

 I' fecks!
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast smutch'd thy nose?
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
Art thou my calf?

 Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
To be full like me: yet they say we are
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
That will say any thing: but were they false
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villian!
Most dear'st! my collop!   Can thy dam?-may't be?--
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Thou dost make possible things not so held,
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
With what's unreal thou coactive art,
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
And that beyond commission, and I find it,
And that to the infection of my brains
And hardening of my brows.

 No, in good earnest.
How sometimes nature will betray its folly
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
This squash, this gentleman.   Mine honest friend,
Will you take eggs for money?

 You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours?

 So stands this squire
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
Apparent to my heart.

 To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
Be you beneath the sky. [Aside] I am angling now,
Though you perceive me not how I give line.
Go to, go to!
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband!
[Exeunt Polixenes, Hermione, and Attendants.Gone already!
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and ears a fork'd one!
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamor
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play. There have been,
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
And many a man there is, even at this present,
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbor, by
Sir Smile, his neighbor: nay, there's comfort in't
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
As mine, against their will. Should all despair
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
'Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
No barricado for a belly; know't;
It will let in and out the enemy
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's

 Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.

'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
When I shall gust it last. How came 't, Camillo
That he did stay?

 At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent;
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
By any understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
But of the finer natures? by some severals
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.

 Ha!

 Ay, but why?

 Satisfy!
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
In that which seems so.

 To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward.
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
From course required; or else thou must be counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
And takest it all for jest.

 Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eyeglass
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
For to a vision so apparent rumor
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
Resides not in that man that does not think,--
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
Or else be impudently negative,
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.

 Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughter with a sigh?--a note infallible
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
If this be nothing.

 Say it be, 'tis true.

 It is; you lie, you lie:
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
Or else a hovering temporizer, that
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
infected as her life, she would not live
The running of one glass.

 Why, he that wears her like her medal, hanging
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
To see alike mine honor as their profits,
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
Have bench'd and rear'd to worship, who mayst see
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
Which draught to me were cordial.

 Make that thy question, and go rot!
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
Without ripe moving to't?   Would I do this?
Could man so blench?

 Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down:
I'll give no blemish to her honor, none.

 This is all:
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

 I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
[Exit. 
 Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

 How blest am I
In my just censure, in my true opinion!
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected: but if one present
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
There is a plot against my life, my crown;
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
He has discover'd my design, and I
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
So easily open?

 I know't too well.
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
Have too much blood in him.

 Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus.

 You, my lords,
Look on her, mark her well; be but about
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
The justice of your hearts will thereto add
''Tis pity she's not honest, honorable:'
Praise her but for this her without-door form.
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
That mercy does, for calumny will sear
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's.
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be't known,
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
She's an adulteress.

 You have mistook, my lady,
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beegar: I have said
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
A federary with her, and one that knows
What she should shame to know herself
But with her most vile principal, that she's
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
To this their late escape.

 No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon,
The centre is not big enough to bear
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks.

 Shall I be heard?

 Go, do our bidding; hence!
[Exit Queen, guarded; with Ladies.
 Hold your peaces.

 Cease; no more.
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't,
As you feel doing thus; and see withal
The instruments that feel.

 What! lack I credit?

 Why, what need we
Commune with you of this, but rather follow
Our forceful instigation?   Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
Imparts this; which if you, or stupified
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
We need no more of your advice: the matter,
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
Properly ours.

 How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant by age,
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
Added to their familiarity,
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
But only seeing, all other circumstances
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
Yet, for a greater confirmation,
For in an act of this importance 'twere
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

 Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined,
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all.

 Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
She the adulteress; for the harlot king
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
I can hook to me; say that she were gone,
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
Might come to me again. Who's there?

 How does the boy?

 To see his nobleness!
Conceiving the dishonor of his mother,
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply.
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
See how he fares. [Exit Serv. Fie, fie! no thought of him:
The very thought of my revenges that way
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
Shall she within my power.
         Enter PAULINA, with a child.
 What noise there, ho?

 How!
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
I charged thee that she should not come about me:
I knew she would.

 What, canst not rule her?

 Good queen!

 Force her hence.

 Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
A most intelligencing bawd!

 Traitors!
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

 He dreads his wife.

 A nest of traitors!

 A callet
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
It is the issue of Polixenes:
Hence with it, and together with the dam
Commit them to the fire!

 A gross hag!
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
That wilt not stay her tongue.

 Once more, take her hence.

 I'll ha' thee burnt.

 On your allegiance.
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
If she did know me one. Away with her!

 Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
And see it instantly consumed with fire;
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight;
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
For thou set'st on thy wife.

 You're liars all.

 I am a feather for each wind that blows:
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
And call me father? better burn it now
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
You that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
So sure as this beard's grey,--what will you adventure
To save this brat's life?

 It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my bidding.

 Mark and perform   it, see'st thou? for the fail
Of any point in't shall not only be
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
Without more mercy, to its own protection
And favor of the climate.   As by strange fortune
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it.   Take it up.

 No, I'll not rear
Another's issue.
                Enter a Servant.
 Twenty three days
They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
Summon a session, that we may arraign
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
Been publicly accused, so shall she have
A just and open trial. While she lives
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
And think upon my bidding.
[Exeunt. This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
Even to the guilt or the purgation.
Produce the prisoner.

 Read the indictment.

 I ne'er heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perform it first.

 You will not own it.

 You knew of his departure, as you know
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.

 Your actions are my dreams;
You had a bastard by Polixenes,
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than death.

 Break up the seals and read.

 Hast thou read truth?

 There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
                 Enter Servant.
 What is the business?

 How! gone!

 Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice.   [Hermione swoons]How now there!

 Take her hence:
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life.
[Exeunt Paulina and Ladies, with Hermione.Apollo, pardon
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
For, being transported by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command, though I with death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him,
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
And fill'd with honor, to my kingly guest
Unclasp'd my practice, quit his fortunes here,
Which you knew great, and to the hazard
Of all incertainties himself commended,
No richer than his honor: how he glisters
Thorough my rust! and how his piety
Does my deeds make the blacker!
                Re-enter PAULINA.
 Go on, go on:
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitterest.

               Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth; which I receive much better
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
The causes of their death appear, unto
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
Will bear up with this exercise, so long
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
Unto these sorrows.
[Exeunt. Whilst I remember
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
My blemishes in them, and so still think of
The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Bred his hopes out of.

 I think so. Kill'd!
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
Say so but seldom.

 Good Paulina,
Who hast the memory of Hermione,
I know, in honor, O, that ever I
Had squared me to thy counsel then, even now,
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
Have taken treasure from her lips--

 Thou speak'st truth.
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
And better used, would make her sainted spirit
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
And begin, 'Why to me?'

 She had; and would incense me
To murder her I married.

 Stars, stars,
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
I'll have no wife, Paulina.

 Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

 My true Paulina,
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.

 What with him? he comes not
Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
By need and accident. What train?

 His princess, say you, with him?

 Go, Cleomenes;
Yourself, assisted with your honor'd friends,
Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
[Exeunt Cleomenes and others. 
He thus should steal upon us.

 Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
Will bring me to consider that which may
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
    Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA.
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
For she did print your royal father off,
Conceiving you: were I but twenty one,
Your father's image is so hit in you,
His very air, that I should call you brother,
As I did him, and speak of something wildly
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
All mine own folly--the society,
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
Though bearing misery, I desire my life
Once more to look on him.

 O my brother,
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
So rarely kind, are as interpreters
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
The adventure of her person?

 Where the warlike Smalus,
That noble honor'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

 The blessed gods
Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Do climate here!   You have a holy father,
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
For which the heavens, taking angry note,
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
As he from heaven merits it, with you
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
Such goodly things as you!
                  Enter a Lord.
 Where's Bohemia? speak.

 Who? Camillo?

 You are married?

 My lord,
Is this the daughter of a king?

 That 'once,' I see by your good father's speed,
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
That you might well enjoy her.

 Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
Which he counts but a trifle.

 I thought of her,
Even in these looks I made. [To Florizel.] But your petition
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
Your honor not o'erthrown by your desires,
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
I now go toward him; therefore follow me
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.
[Exeunt. 
 O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
That I have had of thee!

 O Paulina,
We honor you with trouble: but we came
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
Have we pass'd through, not without much content
In many singularities; but we saw not
That which my daughter came to look upon,
The statue of her mother.

 Her natural posture!
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
As infancy and grace.   But yet, Paulina,
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
So aged as this seems.

 As now she might have done,
So much to my good comfort, as it is
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
There's magic in thy majesty, which has
My evils conjured to remembrance and
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
Standing like stone with thee.

 Do not draw the curtain.

 Let be, let be.
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
Did verily bear blood?

 The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
As we are mock'd with art.

 O sweet Paulina,
Make me to think so twenty years together!
No settled senses of the world can match
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.

 Do, Paulina;
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath?   Let no man mock me,
For I will kiss her.

 No, not these twenty years.

 What can you make her do,
I am content to look on: what to speak,
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
To make her speak as move.

 Proceed:
No foot shall stir.

 O, she's warm!
If this be magic, let it be an art
Lawful as eating.

 O, peace, Paulina!
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
For him, I partly know his mind to find thee
An honorable husband. Come, Camillo,
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
Is richly noted and here justified
By us a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons
That e'er I put between your holy looks
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
Each one demand and answer to his part
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.

[Exeunt.
"
851,mam.,MAMILLIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-mam.," Ay, my good lord.

 Yes, if you will, my lord.

 No, my lord, I'll fight.

 I am like vou, they say.

 No, I'll none of you.

 You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.

 Not for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
Become some women best, so that there be not
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,
Or a half-moon made with a pen.

 I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
What color are your eyebrows?

 Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

 Merry or sad shall't be?

 A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Of sprites and goblins.

 There was a man--

 Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear it.

"
852,cam.,CAMILLO,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-cam.,"       Ay, my good lord.

 You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
When you cast out, it still came home.

 He would not stay at your petitions: made
His business more material.

 At the good queen's entreaty.

 Business, my lord!   I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer.

 Stays here longer.

 To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Of our most gracious mistress.

 Be it forbid, my lord!

 My gracious lord,
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
In every one of these no man is free,
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
Among the infinite doings of the world,
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
If ever I were wilful-negligent,
It was my folly; if industriously
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
Whereof the execution did cry out
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
By its own visage: if I then deny it,
'Tis none of mine.

 I would not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
You never spoke what did become you less
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that, though true.

 Good my lord, be cured
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
For 'tis most dangerous.

 No, no, my lord.

 Who does infect her?

 Sir, my lord,
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
But with a lingering dram that should not work
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
So sovereignly being honorable.
I have loved thee,--

 I must believe you, sir:
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
Will take again your queen as yours at first,
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours.

 My lord,
Go then; and with a countenance as clear
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
If from me he have wholesome beverage,
Account me not your servant.

 I'll do't, my lord.

 O miserable lady!   But, for me,
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obedience to a master, one
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Promotion follows. If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
And flourish'd after, I'd not do't; but since
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
Let villany itself forswear't. I must
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
To me a break-neck. Happy star reign now!
Here comes Bohemia.
              Re-enter POLIXENES.
 Hail, most royal sir!

 None rare, my lord.

 I dare not know, my lord.

 There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
Of you that yet are well.

 I may not answer.

 Sir, I will tell you;
Since I am charged in honor and by him
That I think honorable; therefore mark my counsel,
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
Cry lost, and so good night!

 I am appointed him to murder you.

 By the king.

 He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
As he had seen't or been an instrument
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
Forbiddenly.

 Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences, you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The standing of his body.

 I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Shall bear along unpawn'd, away to-night!
Your followers I will whisper to the business,
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
My fortunes to your service, which are here
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
For, by the honor of my parents, I
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
His execution sworn.

 It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.
[Exeunt.     I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
And only live by gazing.

 He tells her something
That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
The queen of curds and cream.

 This shows a sound affection.

 Why, how now, father!
Speak ere thou diest.

 Gracious my lord,
You know your father's temper: at this time
He will allow no speech, which I do guess
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
Come not before him.

 Even he, my lord.

 Be advised.

 This is desperate, sir.

 O my lord!
I would your spirit were easier for advice,
Or stronger for your need.

 He's irremoveable,
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
His going I could frame to serve my turn,
Save him from danger, do him love and honor,
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
I so much thirst to see.

 Sir, I think
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
That I have borne your father?

 Well, my lord,
If you may please to think I love the king,
And through him   what is nearest to him, which is
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
If your more ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration, on mine honor,
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
As shall become your highness; where you may
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
As heavens forfend!--your ruin; marry her,
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking.

 Have you thought on
A place whereto you'll go?

 Then list to me:
This follows, if you will not change your purpose
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
And there present yourself and your fair princess,
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time.

 Sent by the king your father
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
The manner of your bearing towards him, with
What you as from your father shall deliver,
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say; that he shall not perceive
But that you have your father's bosom there
And speak his very heart.

 A course more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
But as you shake off one to take another;
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
Do their best office, if they can but stay you
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
Prosperity's the very bond of love,
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters.

 Yea, say you so?
There shall not at your father's house these seven years
Be born another such.

 I cannot say 'tis pity
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
To most that teach.

 My lord,
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
To have you royally appointed as if
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
That you may know you shall not want, one word.
[They talk aside.
             Re-enter AUTOLYCUS.
 Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

 Shall satisfy your father.

 Who have we here?
[Seeing Autolycus.
We'll make an instrument of this, omit
Nothing may give us aid.

    Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.

 No remedy.
Have you done there?

 Nay, you shall have no hat.
[Giving it to Perdita.
Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.

 [Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the king
Of this escape and whither they are bound;
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
To force him after: in whose company
I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight
I have a woman's longing.

 The swifter speed the better.
[Exeunt Florizel, Perdita, and Camillo.
 My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
So many summers dry: scarce any joy
Did ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself much sooner.

 She hangs about his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak too.

"
853,ant.,ANTIGONUS,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-ant.," Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

 If it prove
She's otherwise,   I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false,
If she be.

 It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-on
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honor-flaw'd,
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven;
The second and the third, nine, and some five;
If this prove true, they'll pay for't: by mine honor,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.

 If it be so,
We need no grave to bury honesty:
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.

 And I wish, my liege.
You had only in your silent judgement tried it,
Without more overture.

 [Aside] To laughter, as I take it,
If the good truth were known.
[Exeunt. That's enough.

 I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.

 La you now, you hear:
When she will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.

 I am none, by this good light.

 Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
Hardly one subject.

 I did not, sir;
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
Can clear me in't.

 Any thing, my lord,
That my ability may undergo
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
To save the innocent: any thing possible.

 I will, my lord.

 I swear to do this, though a present death
Had been more merciful.   Come on, poor babe:
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses!   Wolves and bears, they say,
Casting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
In more than this deed does require! And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!
[Exit with the child.
 Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

 Their sacred wills be done!   Go, get aboard;
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
I call upon thee.

 Go thou away:
I'll follow instantly.

 Come, poor babe:
I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Did this break from her: 'Good Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks,
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
There lie, and there thy character: there these;
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still rest thine. The storm begins: poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow!   Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamor!
Well may I get aboard!   This is the chase:
I am gone for ever.
[Exit, pursued by a bear.
                Enter a Shepherd.
"
854,cleo.,CLEOMENES,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-cleo.," The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears.

 But of all, the burst
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense,
That I was nothing.

 Great Apollo
Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
So forcing faults upon Hermione,
I little like.

 Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
With them forgive yourself.

 Not at all, good lady:
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Have done the time more benefit and graced
Your kindness better.

 You tempt him over-much.

 Good madam,--
"
855,dion.,DION,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-dion.," I shall report,
For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
It was i' the offering

 If the event o' the journey
Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
The time is worth the use on't.

 The violent carriage of it
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
Shall the contents discover, something rare
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
And gracious be the issue!
[Exeunt. If you would not so,
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
Of his most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
What holier than, for royalty's repair,
For present comfort and for future good,
To bless the bed of majesty again
With a sweet fellow to't?

"
856,pol.,POLIXENES,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-pol.,"  Sir, that's to-morrow.
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
To tire your royalty.

 No longer stay.

 Very sooth, to-morrow.

 Press me not, beseech you, so.
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
Were there necessity in your request, although
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
Farewell, our brother.

 No, madam.

 I may not, verily.

 Your guest, then, madam:
To be your prisoner should import offending;
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punish.

 We were, fair queen,
Two lads that thought there was no more behind
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
And to be boy eternal.

 We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
That any did. Had we pursued that life,
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
Hereditary ours.

 O my most sacred lady!
Temptations have since then been born to's; for
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
Of my young play-fellow.

 What means Sicilia?

 How, my lord!
What cheer? how is 't with you, best brother?

 If at home, sir,
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
He makes a July's day short as December,
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that would thick my blood.

 This is strange: methinks
My favor here begins to warp. Not speak?
Good day, Camillo.

 What is the news i' the court?

 The king hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
With customary compliments; when he,
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
That changeth thus his manners.

 How! dare not! do not. Do you know and dare not?
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must,
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
A party in this alteration, finding
Myself thus alter'd with 't.

 How! caught of me!
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
In ignorant concealment.

 A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
Which may be prevented, if to be;
If not, how best to bear it.

 On, good Camillo.

 By whom, Camillo?

 For what?

 O, then my best blood turn
To an infected jelly and my name
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Turn then my freshest reputation to
A savor that may strike the dullest nostril
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
That e'er was heard or read!

 How should this grow?

 I do believe thee:
I saw his heart in's face. Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbor mine. My ships are ready and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two days ago. This jealousy
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
He is dishonor'd by a man which ever
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

      Shepherdess,--
A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
With flowers of winter.

 Wherefore, gentle maiden,
Do you neglect them?

 Say there be;
Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes that mean; so, over that art
Which you say adds to nature, is an art
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race: this is an art
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
The art itself is nature.

 Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
And do not call them bastards.

 This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
But smacks of something greater than herself,
Too noble for this place.

 Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
Which dances with your daughter?

 She dances featly.

   O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
[To Cam.] Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
He's simple and tells much. [To Flor.]How now, fair shepherd!
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
And handed love as you do, I was wont
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
To her acceptance; you have let him go
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
For a reply, at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her.

 What follows this?
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
But to your protestation; let me hear
What you profess.

 And this my neighbor too?

 Fairly offer'd.

 Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
Have you a father?

 Knows he of this?

 Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
Is not your father grown incapable
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
But what he did being childish?

 By my white beard,
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
Something unfilial: reason my son
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
The father, all whose joy is nothing else
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
In such a business.

 Let him know 't.

 Prithee, let him.

 Mark your divorce, young sir.
[Discovering himself.]
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
The royal fool thou copest with,--

 I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment,--
Worthy enough a herdsman; yea, him too,
That makes himself, but for our honor therein,
Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
These rural latches to his entrance open,
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
I will devise a death as cruel for thee
As thou art tender to't.
[Exit.
 O, not by much.

 Dear my brother,
Let him that was the cause of this have power
To take off so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in himself.

 Masterly done.
The very life seems warm upon her lip.

 She embraces him.

 Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
Or how stolen from the dead.

"
857,flo.,FLORIZEL,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-flo.," These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
And you the queen on't.

 I bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight across
Thy father's ground.

 Apprehend
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
Humbling their deities to love, have taken
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull, and   bellow'd; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
As I seem now. Their transformations
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
Run not before mine honor, nor my lusts
Burn hotter than my faith.

 Thou dearest Perdita,
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
Or not my father's. For I cannot be
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
Of celebration of that nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come.

 See, your guests approach:
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
And let's be red with mirth.
Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised.
 What, like a corse?

 What you do
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
Nothing but that; move still, still so,
And own no other function: each your doing,
So singular in each particular,
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
That all your acts are queens.

 I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
That never mean to part.

 Old sir, I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are:
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
Up in my heart; which I have given already,
But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
Before this ancient sir, who it should seem,
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove's down and as white as it
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd snow that's bolted
By the northern blasts twice o'er.

 Do, and be witness to't.

 And he, and more
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
That, were crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
Without her love; for her employ them all;
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition.

 O, that must be
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us 'fore those witnesses.

 I have: but what of him?

 He neither does nor shall.

 No, good sir;
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age.

 I yield all this;
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
My father of this business.

 He shall not.

 No, he must not.

 Come, come, he must not.
Mark our contract.

 Why look you so upon me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
More straining on for plucking back, not following
My leash unwillingly.

 I not purpose it.
I think, Camillo?

 It cannot fail but by
The violation of my faith; and then
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
From my succession wipe me, father; I
Am heir to my affection.

 I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
Do bid it welcome.

 So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
As you have ever been my father's honor'd friend,
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
Upon his passion: let myself and fortune
Tug for the time to come. This you may know
And so deliver, I am put to sea
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
For this design. What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
Concern me the reporting.

 Hark, Perdita. [Drawing her aside.]
I'll hear you by and by.

 Now, good Camillo;
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony.

 Very nobly
Have you deserved: it is my father's music
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
To have them recompensed as thought on.

 How, Camillo,
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
That I may call thee something more than man
And after that trust to thee.

 Not any yet:
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows.

 Worthy Camillo,
What color for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him?

 I am bound to you:
There is some sap in this.

 My good Camillo,
She is as forward of her breeding as
She is i' the rear our birth.

 My prettiest Perdita!
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
Preserver of my father, now of me,
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's sop,
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

 And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--

  Should I now meet my father,
He would not call me son.

 O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.

 Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

 By his command
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
His wish'd ability, he had himself
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
And those that bear them living.

 Good my lord,
She came from Libya.

 Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
To execute the charge my father gave me
For visiting your highness: my best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
But my arrival and my wife's in safety
Here where we are.

 Camillo has betray'd me;
Whose honor and whose honesty till now
Endured all weathers.

 We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
The odds for high and low's alike.

 She is,
When once she is my wife.

 Dear, look up:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
Remember since you owed no more to time
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
Step forth mine advocate; at your request
My father will grant precious things as trifles.

859,shep.,Old Shepherd,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-shep.,"          Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
With labor and the thing she took to quench it,
She would to each one sip. You are retired,
As if you were a feasted one and not
The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
A way to make us better friends, more known.
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
As your good flock shall prosper.

 They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
Upon his own report and I believe it;
He looks like sooth.   He says he loves my daughter:
I think so too; for never gazed the moon
Upon the water as he'll stand and read
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain,
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best.

 So she does any thing; though I report it,
That should be silent: if young Doricles
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
Which he not dreams of.
                  Enter Servant.
   But, my daughter.
Say you the like to him?

 Take hands, a bargain!
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to't:
I give my daughter to him, and will make
Her portion equal his.

 Come, your hand;
And, daughter, yours.

 Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
At knowing of thy choice.

 O, my heart!

 I cannot speak, nor think,
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
You have undone a man of fourscore three,
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
To die upon the bed my father died,
To lie close by his honest bones: but now
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
That knew'st this was the prince, and wouldst adventure
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
If I might die within this hour, I have lived
To die when I desire.

Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.

While we lie tumbling in the hay.

864,her.,HERMIONE,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-her.," I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
All in Bohemia's well: this satisfaction
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
He's beat from his best ward.

 To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
But let him say so then, and let him go;
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
To let him there a month behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

 Nay, but you will?

 Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths,
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
One of them you shall be.

 Not your gaoler, then,
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
You were pretty lordings then?

 Was not my lord
The verier wag o' the two?

 By this we gather
You have tripp'd since.

 Grace to boot!
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
With any but with us.

 He'll stay, my lord.

 Never?

 What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With spur we heat an acre. But to the goal:
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
What was my first? it has an elder sister,
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Nay, let me have't; I long.

 'Tis grace indeed.
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
The other for some while a friend.

 He something seems unsettled.

 You lookAs if you held a brow of much distraction:
Are you moved, my lord?

 If you would seek us
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there ?

 Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
'Tis past enduring.

 What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
And tell's a tale.

 As merry as you will.

 Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

 Nay, come, sit down; then on.

 Come on, then,And give't me in mine ear.
Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords, and others.
 What is this? sport?

 But I'ld say he had not,
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

 Should a villain say so,
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
He were as much more villain: you, my lord
Do but mistake.

 No, by my life,
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
When you shall come to clearer knowledge that
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake.

 There's some ill planet reigns:
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favorable.   Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honorable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The king's will be perform'd!

 Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
My women may be with me; for you see
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.

 Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part no other
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human actions, as they do,
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than history can pattern, though devised
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
To prate and talk for life and honor 'fore
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honor,
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
And only that I stand for. I appeal
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of honor, or in act or will
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
Cry fie upon my grave!

 That's true enough;
Though 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

 More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
With whom I am accused, I do confess
I loved him as in honor he required,
With such a kind of love as might become
A lady like me, with a love even such,
So and no other, as yourself commanded:
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
For me to try how: all I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man;
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

 Sir,
You speak a language that I understand not:
My life stands in the level of your dreams,
Which I'll lay down.

 Sir, spare your threats:
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
But know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
I am barr'd, like one infectious.   My third comfort,
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
Haled out to murder: myself on every post
Proclaim'd a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i' the open air, before
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die?   Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honor,
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honors all,
I do refer me to the oracle:
Apollo be my judge!

 The Emperor of Russia was my father:
O that he were alive, and here beholding
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge!
 Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION.
 Praised!

 You gods, look down
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own,
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
Myself to see the issue.

"
865,per.,PERDITA,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-per.," Sir, my gracious lord,
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
To show myself a glass.

 Now Jove afford you cause!
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
To think your father, by some accident,
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would he look, to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up? What would he say?   Or how
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
The sternness of his presence?

 O, but, sir,
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
One of these two must be necessities,
Which then will speak, that you must change this purpose,
Or I my life.

 O lady Fortune,
Stand you auspicious!

  [To Pol.] Sir, welcome:
It is my father's will I should take on me
The hostess-ship o' the day.[To Cam.] You're welcome, sir.
Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
Seeming and savor all the winter long:
Grace and remembrance be to you both,
And welcome to our shearing!

 Sir, the year growing ancient,
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o' the season
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
To get slips of them.

 For I have heard it said
There is an art which in their piedness shares
With great creating nature.

 So it is.

 I'll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than were I painted I would wish
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram;
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.

 Out, alas!
You'ld be so lean, that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through. Now, my fair'st friend,
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,
That die unmarried, ere they can behold
Bright Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Most incident to maids: bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To strew him o'er and o'er!

 No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition.

 O Doricles,
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
Do plainly give you an unstain'd shepherd,
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
You woo'd me the false way.

 I'll swear for 'em.

  Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give their dears:
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
What maids lack from head to heel:
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
Buy, lads, or else your lasses cry:Come buy.

 I cannot speak
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his.

 Even here undone!
I was not much afeard; for once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone ?
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
But milk my ewes and weep.

 How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often said, my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!

 One of these is true:
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not take in the mind.

 Your pardon, sir; for this
I'll blush you thanks.

 Happy be you!
All that you speak shows fair.

 I see the play so lies
That I must bear a part.

 O my poor father!
The heaven spies upon us, will not have
Our contract celebrated.

 And give me leave,
And do not say 'tis superstition, that
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

 So long could I
Stand by a looker on.

 Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA.Dear gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady?

 A boy?

 I dare be sworn:
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king, beshrew them!
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
If I prove honey-mouth'd, let my tongue blister
And never to my red-look'd anger be
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedience to the queen:
If she dares trust me with her little babe,
I'll show't the king and undertake to be
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails.

 Tell her, Emilia,
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from my bosom, let't not be doubted
I shall do good.

 You need not fear it, sir:
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
By law and process of great nature thence
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of the king nor guilty of,
If any be, the trespass of the queen.

 Do not you fear: upon mine honor, I
Will stand betwixt you and danger.
[Exeunt. Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
More free than he is jealous.

 Not so hot, good sir:
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
At each his needless heavings, such as you
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
Do come with words as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, to purge him of that humor
That presses him from sleep.

 No noise, my lord; but needful conference
About some gossips for your highness.

 From all dishonesty he can: in this,
Unless he take the course that you have done,
Commit me for committing honor, trust it,
He shall not rule me.

 Good my liege, I come;
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
Less appear so in comforting your evils,
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
From your good queen.

 Good queen, my lord,
Good queen; I say good queen;
And would by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the worst about you.

 Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
[Laying down the child.
 Not so:
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me, and no less honest
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
As this world goes, to pass for honest.

 For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upon't!

 So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld call your children yours.

 Nor I, nor any
But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
The sacred honor of himself, his queen's,
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's; and will not--
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
The root of his opinion, which is rotten
As ever oak or stone was sound.

 It is yours;
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
Although the print be little, the whole matter
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,His smiles,
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
So like to him that got it, if thou hast
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colors
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does.
Her children not her husband's!

 A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Can do no more.

 I care not:
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
Not able to produce more accusation
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savors
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yea, scandalous to the world.

 I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours: Jove send her
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
Will never do him good, not one of you.
So, so: farewell; we are gone.
[Exit. 
 This news is mortal to the queen: look down
And see what death is doing.

 Woe the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too!

 What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polixenes, 'twas nothing;
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honor,
To have him kill a king; poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
To be or none or little; though a devil
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
When I have said, cry 'woe!'--the queen, the queen,
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead, and vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.

 I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir: therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren mountain, and still winter
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert.

 I am sorry for't:
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you, rather
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
Of what you should forget.   Now, good my liege,
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
I'll not remember you of my own lord,
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
And I'll say nothing.

 True, too true, my lord:
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
Or from the all that are took something good,
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
Would be unparallel'd.

 You are one of those
Would have him wed again.

 There is none worthy,
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
For has not the divine Apollo said,
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
That King Leontes shall not have an heir
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come again to me; who, on my life,
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
Oppose against their wills. [To Leontes.] Care not for issue;
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
Was like to be the best.

 And left them
More rich for what they yielded.

 Had she such power,
She had just cause.

 I should so.
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
Should be 'Remember mine.'

 Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave?

 Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

 Unless another,
As like Hermione as is her picture,
Affronts his eye.

 I have done.
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
As was your former; but she shall be such
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost, it should take joy
To see her in your arms.

 That
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
Never till then.
               Enter a Gentleman.
 O Hermione,
As every present time doth boast itself
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
Have said and writ so, but your writing now
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say you have seen a better.

 How! not women?

 Had our prince,
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
Well with this lord: there was not full a month
Between their births.

 Sir, my liege,
Your eye hath too much youth in't; not a month
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
Than what you look on now.

 What, sovereign, sir,
I did not well I meant well. All my services
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
It is a surplus of your grace, which never
My life may last to answer.

 As she lived peerless,
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
[Paulina draws a curtain, and discovers Hermione standing like a statue.
I like your silence, it the more shows off
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege.
Comes it not something near?

 So much the more our carver's excellence;
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
As she lived now.

 O, patience!
The statue is but newly fix'd, the color's
Not dry.

 Indeed, my lord,
If I had thought the sight of my poor image
Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
I'ld not have show'd it.

 No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
May think anon it moves.

 I'll draw the curtain:
My lord's almost so far transported that
He'll think anon it lives.

 I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
I could afflict you farther.

 Good my lord, forbear:
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

 Either forbear,
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
For more amazement. If you can behold it,
I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
And take you by the hand: but then you'll think--
Which I protest against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.

 It is required
You do awake your faith.   Then all stand still;
On: those that think it unlawful business
I am about, let them depart.

 Music, awake her; strike! [Music.
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:[Hermione comes down.
Start not; her actions shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
Until you see her die again; for then
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
Is she become the suitor?

 That she is living,
Were it but told you, should be hooted at
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
Though yet she speak not.   Mark a little while.
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
Our Perdita is found.

 There's time enough for that;
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Your joys with like relation. Go together,
You precious winners all; your exultation
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
Will wing me some wither'd bough and there
My mate, that's never to be found again,
Lament till I am lost.

Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
A shepherd's daughter.

 Here in your city; I now came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
My marvel and my message. To your court
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
The father of this seeming lady and
Her brother, having both their country quitted
With this young prince.

 Lay't so to his charge:
He's with the king your father.

 Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I

Forswear themselves as often as they speak:

In fair Bohemia; and remember well,

I now name to you; and with speed so pace

 Of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
But that to your sufficiency........
....................as your worth is able,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.

[Exit an Attendant.
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power: what think you of it?

 Look where he comes.
                 Enter ANGELO.
 Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

 No more evasion:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well:
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.

 My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own,
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Though it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

 I thank you. Fare you well.
[Exit.
 No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

 My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?

 We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.

 I do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office;
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

Exeunt.
 Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.

 Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.

 When must he die?

 Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

 I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be sound,
Or hollowly put on.

 Love you the man that wrong'd you?

 So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?

 Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

 'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear,--

 There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite! [Exit.
 So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

 Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter.   Reason thus with life:
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet runn'st toward him still.   Thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provokes; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st.   Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee.   Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner.   Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for ail thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

 Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

 Provost, a word with you.

 Bring me to hear them speak, where
I may be concealed.
[Exeunt Duke and Provost.
 Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

               Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

 Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.

 That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our fault as faults from seeming, free!

                    No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?

To use it for my time: I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his holiness.

     He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to know,
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practice on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things
Craft against vice I must apply:
With Angelo to-night shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
And perform an old contracting.

Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.

 O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA.
Welcome, how agreed?

 It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.

 Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract:
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

[Exeunt.
 The best and wholesomest spirits of the night
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

 Not Isabel?

 They will, then, ere't be long.

 There's some in hope.

 Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
[Knocking within.]
Now are they come.

[Exit Provost.
This is a gentle provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
[Knocking within.] 
How now! what noise? That spirit's possess'd with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
               Re-enter PROVOST.
 Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?

 As near the dawning, provost as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.

 And here comes Claudlo's pardon.
 This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in.
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
When it is borne in high authority:
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
Now, sir, what news?

 Pray you, let's hear.

                 Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
[Exeunt Abhorson and Pompey.
                Enter PROVOST.
 A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

 O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

 Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.

 Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
[Exit Provost.
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them,--whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.
              Re-enter PROVOST.
 Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.

 The tongue of Isabel.   She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected.
               Enter ISABELLA.
 Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

 He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

 It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
In your close patience.

 You shall not be admitted to his sight.

 This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
One of our convent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the duke, revenge to your heart,
And general honour.

 This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart: trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?
                 Enter Lucio.
 Not within, sir.

  Well, you'll answer this one day.
Fare ye well.

  Did you such a thing?

  These letters at fit time deliver me:
[Giving letters.
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.

 I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

[Exeunt.
 My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

 Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

 O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand;
And good supporters are you.
FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward.
 Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.

 Nay, it is ten times strange.

 Away with her! Poor soul,
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

 By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

 Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

 You were not bid to speak.

 I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

 The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.

 It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.

 That's somewhat madly spoken.

 Mended again. The matter; proceed.

 This is most likely!

 By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practice. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou camest here to complain.

 I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us?   This needs must be a practice.
Who knew of your intent and coming hither?

 A ghostly father, belike.   Who knows that Lodowick?

 Words against me! this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

 We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

 Good friar, let's hear it.

Isabella is carried off guarded; and
Mariana comes forward.
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?

First let her show her face, and after speak.

       This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

 No? you say your husband.

 Know you this woman?

 Sirrah, no more!

 Ay, with my heart;
And punish them to your height of pleasure
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation?   You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.

 Go do it instantly.
[Exit Provost.
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers.

  Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

 Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

 Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.

     Stay, sir; stay awhile.

 Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
 [To Lucio]
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

 What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
We'll borrow place of him. [To Angelo]
Sir, by your leave.
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
And hold no longer out.

 Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

 Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

[Exeunt Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost.
 Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
Advertising and holy to your business;
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.

 You are pardon'd, Isabel:
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Laboring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.

 For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!

 It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
And choke your good to come: for his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal,
To buy you a better husband.

 Never crave him; we are definitive.

 You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death! [To Lucio]
Now, sir, to you.

 Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact.
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

 He dies for Claudio's death.

 Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

 Had you a special warrant for the deed?

 For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.

 What's he?

 I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

[Exit Provost.
 Which is that Barnardine?

 There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squarest thy life according.   Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

 If he be like your brother, for his sake
Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake,
Give me your hand and say you will be mine,
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
I find an apt remission in myself;
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
[To Lucio]
You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
Wherein have I so deserved of you,
That you extol me thus?

 Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city,
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

 Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.

 Slandering a prince deserves it.
[Exeunt Officers with Lucio.
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shall employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
[Exeunt. 
"
885,ang.,ANGELO,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-ang.," Always obedient to your grace's will,
I come to know your pleasure.

 Now, good my lord,
Let there be some more test made of my metal,
Before so noble and so great a figure
Be stamp'd upon it.

 Yet give leave, my lord,
That we may bring you something on the way.

 The heavens give safety to your purposes!

 'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point.

 We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror.

 'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
Another thing to fall. I not deny,
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
Guiltier than him they try.   What's open made to justice,
That justice seizes: what know the laws
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon, and never think of it.
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
When I, that censure him, do so offend,
Let mine own judgement pattern out my death,
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

 Where is the provost?

 See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
[Exit Provost.
     This will last out a night in Russia,
When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave,
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

 Now, what's the matter, provost?

 Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
Why dost thou ask again?

 Go to; let that be mine:
Do you your office. or give up your place,
And you shall well be spared.

 Dispose of her
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
               Re-enter Servant.
 Hath he a sister?

 Well, let her be admitted.
[Exit Servant.
See you the fornicatress be removed:
Let her have needful, but not lavish, means;
There shall be order for't.
         Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO.
 Stay a little while. To Isab.
You're welcome: what's your will?

 Well; what's your suit?

 Well; the matter?

 Condemn the fault, and not the actor of it?
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
Mine were the very cipher of a function,
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
And let go by the actor.

 Maiden, no remedy.

 I will not do't.

 Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

 He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

 Pray you, be gone.

 Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
And you but waste your words.

 Be you content, fair maid;
It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

 The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
Those many had not dared to do that evil,
If the first that did the edict infringe
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake,
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
Are now to have no successive degrees,
But, ere they live, to end.

 I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know,
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

 Why do you put these sayings upon me?

 She speaks, and 'tis
Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.

 I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

 How! bribe me?

 Well; come to me to-morrow.

 Amen:
For I am that way going to temptation,
Where prayers cross.

 At any time 'fore noon.

 From thee, even from thy virtue!
What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine,
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
Ha!
Not she; nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That, lying by the violet in the sun,
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there?   O, fie, fie, fie!
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O, let her brother live:
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
That I desire to hear her speak again,
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
With all her double vigour, art and nature,
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite. Ever till now,
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.
[Exit. 
 When I would pray and think, I think and pray
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
As if I did but only chew his name;
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception.   The state, whereon I studied,
Is like a good thing, being often read,
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming!   Blood, thou art blood:
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn;
'Tis not the devil's crest.
              Enter a SERVANT.
Now now! who's there?

 Teach her the way. [Exit Serv.
O heavens!
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
Making both it unable for itself,
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him, and so stop the air
By which he should revive: and even so
The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence.
                Enter ISABELLA.
How now, fair maid?

 That you might know it, would much better please me
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

 Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
As long as you or I: yet he must die.

 Yea.

 Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made, as to remit
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.

 Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather, that the most just law
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
As she that he hath stain'd?

 I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.

 Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I, now the voice of the recorded law,
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?

 Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

 Nay, but hear me.
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.

 Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
Your brother is to die.

 And his offence is so, as it appears,
Accountant to the law upon that pain.

 Admit no other way to save his life,--
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
Finding yourself desired of such a person,
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
Of the all-building law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him, but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer,
What would you do?

 Then must your brother die.

 Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?

 You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.

 We are all frail.

 Nay, women are frail too.

 I think it well:
And from this testimony of your own sex,--
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold:
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
If you be one, as you are well express'd
By all external warrants, show it now,
By putting on the destined livery.

 Plainly conceive, I love you.

 He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

 Believe me, on mine honour,
My words express my purpose.

 Who will believe thee, Isabel?
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
Will so your accusation overweigh,
That you shall stifle in your own report
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death,
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
[Exit. 
    This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
And dull to all proceedings.   A deflower'd maid!
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it!   But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
How might she tongue me!   Yet reason dares her no;
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
That no particular scandal once can touch
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
Save that his riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
By so receiving a dishonour'd life
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
Alack, when once our grace we have forgot,
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.
[Exit. 
 You make my bonds still greater.

 My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice,--

 And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

 Charges she more than me?

 This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

 My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition, but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of five years
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
Upon my faith and honour.

 I did but smile till now:
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice;
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
To find this practice out.

 What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
Is this the man that you did tell us of?

   O my dread lord,
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
To think I can be undiscernible,
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
No longer session hold upon my shame,
But let my trial be mine own confession:
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg.

 I was, my lord.

 I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
    Re-enter PROVOST, with BARNARDINE,
   CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIET.
"
886,escal.,ESCALUS,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-escal.," My lord.

 If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour,
It is Lord Angelo.

 Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

 I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A power I have, but of what strength and nature
I am not yet instructed.

 I'll wait upon your honour.
[Exeunt.
 Ay, but yet
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
Than fall, and bruise to death.   Alas, this gentleman,
Whom I would save, had a most noble father
Let but your honour know,
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
That, in the working of your own affections,
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
Or that the resolute acting of your blood
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
And pull'd the law upon you.

 Be it as your wisdom will.

 Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:
And some condemned for a fault alone.

           I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
[Exit Angelo. 
                             It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
But there's no remedy.

 It is but needful:
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
Come, sir.
[Exeunt.
               My lord, we'll do it throughly.

[Exit Duke.
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

  Call that same Isabel here once again:
I would speak with her. [Exit an Attendant.
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question;
 you shall see how I'll handle her.

       The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.

 Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear,
To call him villain? and then to glance from him
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
What 'unjust'!

 Slander to the state!   Away with him to prison!

  My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
Than at the strangeness of it.

 I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood,
And lack of temper'd judgement afterward.

"
887,claud.,CLAUDIO,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-claud.," Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

 Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
Re-enter Lucio and two Gentlemen.
 From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
As surfeit is the father of much fast,
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

 What but to speak of would offend again.

   One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

 Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
Save that we do the deunciation lack
Of outward order: this we came not to,
Only for propagation of a dower
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

 Unhappily, even so.
And the new deputy now for the duke--
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
Whether the tyranny be in his place,
Or in his eminence that fills it up,
I stagger in:--but this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

 I have done so, but he's not to be found.
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And there receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect,
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse,
And well she can persuade.

 I thank you, good friend Lucio.

 Come, officer, away!

[Exeunt.
 The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die,

 I humbly thank you.
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
And seeking death, find life: let it come on.

 Most holy sir, I thank you.
Enter ISABELLA.
 Now, sister, what's the comfort?

 Is there no remedy?

 But is there any?

 Perpetual durance?

 But in what nature?

 Let me know the point.

 Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride,
And hug it in mine arms.

 The prenzie Angelo!

 O heavens! it cannot be.

 Thou shalt not do't

 Thanks, dear Isabel.

 Yes. Has he affections in him,
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin;
Or of the deadly seven it is the least.

 If it were damnable, he being so wise,
Why would he for the momentary trick
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

 Death is a fearful thing.

 Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death.

 Sweet sister, let me live:
What sin you do to save a brother's life,
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue.

 Nay, hear me, Isabel.

 O hear me, Isabella!
                Re-enter DUKE.
  As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
He will not wake.

"
888,lucio.,LUCIO,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-lucio.,"                Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

    A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?

 With child, perhaps?

   Within two hours.

 Ho! Peace be in this place!

 Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?

 Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

 For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.

 It is true.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted,
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

 Do not believe it.  Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embraced:
As those that feed grow full as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

 Is she your cousin?

 She it is.

 This is the point.
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows close the rigour of the statute,
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.

 Has censured him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for his execution.

 Assay the power you have.

 Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

 But speedily.

 I take my leave of you.

 Give't not o'er so: to him again, entreat him;
Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:
To him, I say!

 You are too cold.

 Ay, touch him; there's the vein.

 Ay, well said.

 That's well said.

 O, to him, to him, wench! he will relent;
He's coming; I perceive't.

 Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o' that.

 Art avised o' that? more on't.

 You had marr'd all else.

 Go to; 'tis well; away!

                           Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

       That's I, an't like your grace;
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.

 No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

 I warrant your honour.

 Right.

 My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord,
For certain words he spake against your grace
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.

 But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.

 My lord, most villanously; believe it.

  Well, my lord.

   Carnally, she says.

 Enough, my lord.

  As any in Vienna, on my word.

      This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

      This may prove worse than hanging.

 Pray you, do. [Exit Servant.] I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!
                 Enter ANGELO.
 Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

 Lest I might be too rash:
Under your good correction. I have seen,
When, after execution, judgement hath
Repented o'er his doom.

 I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.

 Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.

 God save your honour!

 Heaven give thee moving graces!

 Pray heaven she win him!

 I am the provost.   What's your will, good friar?

 I would do more than that, if more were needed.
                 Enter JULIET.
Look here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
More fit to do another such office
Than die tor this.

 As I do think, to-morrow,
I have provided for you: stay awhile, [To Juliet.]
And you shall be conducted.

 'Tis pity of him. [Exeunt.
 Who's there?  come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

 And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.

 As many as you please.

            The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
                Enter CLAUDIO.
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?

 Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself. [Knocking within.
But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!   [Exit Claudio.
By and by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio. Enter DUKE disguised as before.
Welcome, father.

 None, since the curfew rung.

 No.

 What comfort is for Claudio?

 It is a bitter deputy.

 There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

 None, sir, none.

 Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.
             Enter a MESSENGER.
This is his lordship's man.

              But what likelihood is in that?

 I know them both.

 Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

 Here in the prison, father,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

 This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?

 I am your free dependant.

 Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

 I'll make all speed.
[Exit.
 It was commanded so.

 No, my good lord; it was by private message.

 Pardon me, noble lord:
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice:
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserved alive.

 His name is Barnardine.

                           This, my lord.

 This is another prisoner that I saved,
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself.

[Unmuffles Claudio.

Than in Lord Angelo.

                Enter VARRIUS.
 Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!
Exeunt.
 Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.

 Blessed be your royal grace!
I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot.

 I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
As he's reported by this gentleman;
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

 Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
But at this instant he is sick, my lord,
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
Is true and false; and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear,
Whensoever he's convented.   First, for this woman,
To justify this worthy nobleman,
So vulgarly and personally accused,
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
Till she herself confess it.

 Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him.

 Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister.

 Woe me! for what?

 Sir, make me not your story.

 You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

 Some one with child by him?   My cousin Juliet?

 Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.

 O, let him marry her.

 Doth he so seek his life?

 Alas! What poor ability's in me
To do him good?

 My power?   Alas, I doubt--

 I'll see what I can do.

 I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.

 Good sir, adieu.

[Exeunt.
 I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour hear me.

 There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow   of justice;
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not.

 I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother.

 O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then.  Heaven keep your honour!

 Must he needs die?

 Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

 But can you, if you would?

 But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?

 Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word,
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you and you as he,
You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.

 I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
And what a prisoner.

 Alas, alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
If He, which is the top of judgement, should
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips
Like man new made.

 To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.

 Yet show some pity.

 So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he, that suffers. O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.

 Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drest in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.

 We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
But in the less foul profanation.

 That in the captain's but a choleric word,
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

 Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.

 Gentle my lord, turn back.

 Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

 Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

 Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.

 Heaven keep your honour safe!

 At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your worship?

 'Save your honour!

[Exeunt Isabella, Luclo, and Provost.
 I am come to know your pleasure.

 Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

 Under your sentence?

 When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.

 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

 Sir, believe this,
I had rather give my body than my soul.

 How say you?

 Please you to do't.
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

 That I do beg his life if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.

 Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
But graciously to know I am no better.

 So.

 True.

 As much for my poor brother as myself:
That is, were I under the terms of death,
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
And strip myself to death, as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld
My body up to shame.

 And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once,
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.

 Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

 O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hate,
For his advantage that I dearly love,

 Else let my brother die,
If not a feodary, but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.

 Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women!   Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

 I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Let me entreat you speak the former language.

 My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for it.

 I know your virtue hath a license in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.

 Ha! little honour to be much believed,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
What man thou art.

 To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
Either of condemnation or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will;
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour,
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest
[Exit
 What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!

 My business is a word or two with Claudio.

 Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.

 None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.

 Yes, brother, you may live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
But fetter you till death.

 Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determined scope.

 In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked.

 O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.

 There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances.   This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.

 O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst be freed.

 Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.

 O, were it but my life,
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.

 Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

 Which is the least?

 What says my brother?

 And shamed life a hateful.

 Alas, alas!

 O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretchl
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.

 O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.

 What is your will?

          He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes his opening with this bigger key:
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.

 I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me
The way twice o'er.

 No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
I come about my brother.

 I do desire the like.

 She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.

 Little have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'

 Peace, ho, be here!

 Ho, by your leave!

 The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

 Nay, but it is not so.

 O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

 Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

 I am directed by you.

 To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

 Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

 O, peace! the friar is come,
              Enter FRIAR PETER.
 Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

 O worthy duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must either punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

 By course of justice!

 Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer; is't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it not strange and strange?

 It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of reckoning.

 O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness!  Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I more name for badness.

 O gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.

 I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo;
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,--

 That's he indeed.

 This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

 I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

 Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.

 In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.

 O, that it were as like as it is true!

 And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is here wrap't up
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

 One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

 O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty

 I do, my lord.
Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER,
                 and PROVOST.
 Most bounteous sir,
[Kneeling.]
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.

"
901,mari.,MARIANA,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-mari.," Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
Exit Boy. Enter DUKE disguised as before. 
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

   Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

 Will 't please you walk aside?
[Exeunt Mariana and Isabella.
 Fear me not.

 Be ruled by him.

 I would Friar Peter--

 Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me.

    My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.

 Now I come to't, my lord:
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
And charges him, my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love.

 Not that I know.

 Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

 My husband bids me; now I will
 unmask.
Unveiling. 
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagined person.

 Noble prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees;
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!

 O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

 O my dear lord,
I crave no other, nor no better man.

 Gentle my liege,--
[Kneeling.]
 O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.

 Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
And, for the most, become much more the better
For being a little bad: so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

 Merely, my lord.

"
902,jul.,JULIET,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-jul.," I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

 I'll gladly learn.

 Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

 Mutually.

 I do confess it, and repent it, father.

 I do repent me, as it is an evil,
And take the shame with joy.

 Must die to-morrow!   O injurious love,
That respites me a life, whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror!

"
903,fran.,FRANCISCA,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-fran.," Are not these large enough?

 It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
But in the presence of the prioress:
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
He calls again; I pray you, answer him.

         My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.

 No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?

 Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
And I will break with her and with her father,
And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?

 What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
Look, what will serve is fit; 'tis once, thou lovest,
And I will fit thee with the remedy.
I know we shall have revelling to-night:
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
Then after to her father will I break;
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practice let us put it presently.
                          [Exeunt.
                      By my troth, a pleasant-spirited
lady.

     And you too, gentle Hero?

   See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

 Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.

 It is the witness still of excellency
To put a strange face on his own perfection.
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.

 Now, pray thee, come;
Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
Do it in notes.

 Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.  [Air. 
 By my troth, a good song.

    May be she doth but counterfeit.

 Why, what effects of passion shows she?

                                Why, what's the matter?

   O day untowardly turned!

 Nothing, unless you render her again.

 What should I speak?
I stand dishonor'd, that have gone about
To link my dear friend to a common stale.

 Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honor,
Myself, my brother and this grieved count
Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
A thousand times in secret.

 Good den, good den.

 We have some haste, Leonato.

 Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.

 You say not right, old man.

 Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing
But what was true and very full of proof.

 I will not hear you.

 See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
Enter BENEDICK.
      What, a feast, a feast?

    He is in earnest.

        Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?

 But did my brother set thee on to this?

 He is composed and framed of treachery:
And fled he is upon this villany.

 By my soul, nor I:
And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
I would bend under any heavy weight
That he'll enjoin me to.

 We will not fail.

 Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.

 Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
And then to Leonato's we will go.

 Good morrow to this fair assembly.

 Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
That you have such a February face,
So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?

 The former Hero! Hero that is dead!

 Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
Not to be spoke of;
There is not chastity enough in language
Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.

975,claud.,CLAUDIO,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml-claud.,"  Is she not a modest young lady?

   Can the world buy such a jewel?

   If this were so, so were it uttered.

   And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.

     My liege, your highness now may do me good.

 Hath Leonato any son, my lord?

 O, my lord,
When you went onward on this ended action,
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
Than to drive liking to the name of love:
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.

 How sweetly you do minister to love,
That know love's grief by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.

   Thus answer I in name of Benedick,
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love:
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
Let every eye negotiate for itself
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
This is an accident of hourly proof,
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!
Re-enter BENEDICK.

 Yea, the same.

 Whither?

 I wish him joy of her.

 I pray you, leave me,

 If it will not be, I'll leave you.
                                [Exit.
    And so she doth, cousin.

  And I, my lord.

 Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!

 O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.
Enter BALTHASAR with Music.
  Faith, like enough.

 Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.

 She did, indeed.

               I hope he be in love.

  Yet say I, he is in love.

    And when was he wont to wash his
face?

          O mischief strangely thwarting!

    Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
Will you with free and unconstrained soul
Give me this maid, your daughter?

 And what have I to give you back, whose worth
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?

 Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
There, Leonato, take her back again:
Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
She's but the sign and semblance of her honor.
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
O, what authority and show of truth
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
Comes not that blood as modest evidence
To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
All you that see her, that she were a maid,
By these exterior shows? But she is none:
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

 Not to be married,
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.

 I know what you would say: if I have known her,
You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
No, Leonato,
I never tempted her with word too large;
But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
Bashful sincerity and comely love.

 Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
But you are more intemperate in your blood
Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
That rage in savage sensuality.

 Leonato, stand I here?
Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?

 Let me but move one question to your daughter;
And, by that fatherly and kindly power
That you have in her, bid her answer truly.

 To make you answer truly to your name.

 Marry, that can Hero;
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.

 O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
If half thy outward graces had been placed
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
And never shall it more be gracious.

 Good day to both of you.

 Who wrongs him?

 Marry, beshrew my hand,
If it should give your age such cause of fear:
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.

 My villany?

 Away! I will not have to do with you.

        God bless me from a challenge!

           I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.

 Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
In the rare semblance that I loved it first.

 I know not how to pray your patience;
Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
Impose me to what penance your invention
Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
But in mistaking.

 O noble sir,
Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
I do embrace your offer; and dispose
For henceforth of poor Claudio.

 To-night I'll mourn with Hero.

  Done to death by slanderous tongues
   Was the Hero that here lies:
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
   Gives her fame which never dies.
So the life that died with shame
   Lives in death with glorious fame.
Hang thou there upon the tomb,
Praising her when I am dumb.
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.

SONG.
		  
 Pardon, goddess of the night,
		    Those that slew thy virgin knight;
		    For the which, with songs of woe,
		    Round about her tomb they go.
		    Midnight, assist our moan;
		    Help us to sigh and groan,
		    Heavily, heavily:
		    Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
		    Till death be uttered,
		    Heavily, heavily.

 And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.

 I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.

 I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
When he would play the noble beast in love.

 For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.
Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked.
Which is the lady I must seize upon?

 Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.

 Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
I am your husband, if you like of me.

 Another Hero!

 And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
For here's a paper written in his hand,
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
Fashion'd to Beatrice.

 Come, will you go with me?

               Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
		      Men were deceivers ever,
		      One foot in sea and one on shore,
		      To one thing constant never:
		      Then sigh not so, but let them go,
		      And be you blithe and bonny,
		      Converting all your sounds of woe
		      Into Hey nonny, nonny.
		      Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
		      Of dumps so dull and heavy;
		      The fraud of men was ever so,
		      Since summer first was leavy:
		      Then sigh not so, &c.
		            Gallants, I am not as I have been.

 I have the toothache.

     This looks not like a nuptial.

 How doth the lady?

 Sir, sir, be patient.
For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
I know not what to say,

 Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?

 Two of them have the very bent of honor;
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
The practice of it lives in John the bastard,
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.

 Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
And though you know my inwardness and love
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
Yet, by mine honor, I will deal in this
As secretly and justly as your soul
Should with your body.

                                     The god of love,
	      That sits above,
	      And knows me, and knows me,
	      How pitiful I deserve,—
	     O, stay but till then!

         I will go with thee to thy uncle's. [Exeunt.
 And so am I, being else by faith enforced
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.

 Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.

 To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
Your niece regards me with an eye of favor.

 And I do with an eye of love requite her.

 Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
But, for my will, my will is your good will
May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
In the state of honorable marriage:
In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.

 Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
And got a calf in that same noble feat
Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.

 Soft and fair, friar.   Which is Beatrice?

 Do not you love me?

 Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
Have been deceived; they swore you did.

 Troth, no; no more than reason.

 They swore that you were almost sick for me.

 'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?

  Peace! I will stop your mouth.
                [Kissing her.
    Think not on him till to-morrow:
I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.

        Well, then, go you into hell?

                           So say I: methinks you are sadder.

 Where is but a humor or a worm.

                As freely, son, as God did give her me.

 What do you mean, my lord?

 Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
And made defeat of her virginity,—

 Sweet prince, why speak not you?

 Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?

 All this is so: but what of this, my lord?

 I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.

 Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
[Hero swoons. 
 O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
Death is the fairest cover for her shame
That may be wish'd for.

 Dost thou look up?

 Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
The story that is printed in her blood?
Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
Why had I not with charitable hand
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
That I myself was to myself not mine,
Valuing of her,—why, she, O, she is fallen
Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
And salt too little which may season give
To her foul-tainted flesh!

 Confirm'd, confirm'd!   O, that is stronger made
Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.

 Friar, it cannot be.
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
Is that she will not add to her damnation
A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
That which appears in proper nakedness?

 I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honor,
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
Nor age so eat up my invention,
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
Ability in means and choice of friends,
To quit me of them throughly.

 What shall become of this? what will this do?

 Being that I flow in grief,
The smallest twine may lead me.

 I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
Which falls into mine ears as profitless
As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
Bring me a father that so loved his child,
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
And bid him speak of patience;
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
And let it answer every strain for strain,
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
And I of him will gather patience.
But there is no such man: for, brother, men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
Their counsel turns to passion, which before
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
Charm ache with air and agony with words:
No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

 I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;
For there was never yet philosopher
That could endure the toothache patiently,
However they have writ the style of gods
And made a push at chance and sufferance.

 There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince
And all of them that thus dishonor her.

 Hear you, my lords,—

 Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.

 Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:—
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
I fear thee not.

 Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
As under privilege of age to brag
What I have done being young, or what would do
Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
That I am forced to lay my reverence by
And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
And she lies buried with her ancestors;
O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!

 Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.

 My lord, my lord,
I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
Despite his nice fence and his active practice,
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.

 Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.

 Brother,—

 Brother Anthony,—

 But, brother Anthony,—

 My lord, my lord,—

 No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.

 Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,
That, when I note another man like him,
I may avoid him: which of these is he?

 Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
Mine innocent child?

 No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
Here stand a pair of honorable men;
A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.

 I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
Possess the people in Messina here
How innocent she died; and if your love
Can labor ought in sad invention,
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:
To-morrow morning come you to my house,
And since you could not be my son-in-law,
Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
And she alone is heir to both of us:
Give her the right you should have given heir cousin,
And so dies my revenge.

 To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,
Hired to it by your brother.

 I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.

 There's for thy pains.

  Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.

 Bring you these fellows on. We'll talk with Margaret,
How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
[Exeunt, severally. 
 So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
Upon the error that you heard debated:
But Margaret was in some fault for this,
Although against her will, as it appears
In the true course of all the question.

 Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,
Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.
                       [Exeunt Ladies.
The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
To visit me. You know your office, brother:
You must be father to your brother's daughter,
And give her to young Claudio.

 That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.

 The sight whereof I think you had from me,
From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?

 My heart is with your liking.

 Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio;
We here attend you. Are you yet determined
To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?

 Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.
[Exit Antonio. 
 No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
Before this friar and swear to marry her.

 She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.

 Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.

 We'll have dancing afterward.

Against yourself.

 Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
Make those that do offend you suffer too.

 Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.
 Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO. 
 If he could right himself with quarrelling,
Some of us would lie low.

 He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:
Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.

 Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
That dare as well answer a man indeed
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:
Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!

 Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,—
Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
And this is all.

 Come, 'tis no matter:
Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.

 And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
[Exeunt Leonato and Antonio 
 Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.

 Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.

Yet will he swear he loves.

"
982,friar.,FRIAR FRANCIS,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml-friar.,"     Have comfort, lady.

 Yea, wherefore should she not?

 Hear me a little; for I have only been
Silent so long and given way unto
This course of fortune....
By noting of the lady I have mark'd
A thousand blushing apparitions
To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
To burn the errors that these princes hold
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
Trust not my reading nor my observations,
Which with experimental seal doth warrant
The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
Under some biting error.

 Lady, what man is he you are accused of?

 There is some strange misprision in the princes.

 Pause awhile,
And let my counsel sway you in this case.
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
And publish it that she is dead indeed;
Maintain a mourning ostentation
And on your family's old monument
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
That appertain unto a burial.

 Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
But not for that dream I on this strange course,
But on this travail look for greater birth.
She dying, as it must be so maintain'd,
Upon the instant that she was accused,
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
Of every hearer: for it so falls out
That what we have we prize not to the worth
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
Why, then we rack the value, then we find
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
When he shall hear she died upon his words,
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Into his study of imagination,
And every lovely organ of her life
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
More moving-delicate and full of life,
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
If ever love had interest in his liver,
And wish he had not so accused her,
No, though he thought his accusation true.
Let this be so, and doubt not but success
Will fashion the event in better shape
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
The supposition of the lady's death
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
As best befits her wounded reputation,
In some reclusive and religious life,
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.

 'Tis well consented: presently away;
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.
[Exeunt all but Benedick and Beatrice.
 Did I not tell you she was innocent?

 To do what, signior?

 And my help.
Here comes the prince and Claudio.
Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or three others.
 All this amazement can I qualify;
When after that the holy rites are ended,
I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:

And to the chapel let us presently.

987,hero.,HERO,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml-hero.,"        Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites,
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
To listen our purpose. This is thy office;
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.

 Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
As we do trace this alley up and down,
Our talk must only be of Benedick.
When I do name him, let it be thy part
To praise him more than ever man did merit:
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
That only wounds by hearsay.
Enter BEATRICE, behind.
Now begin;

For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.

 Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
                 [Approaching the bower.
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
As haggerds of the rock.

 So says the prince and my newtrothed lord.

 They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
To wish him wrestle with affection,
And never to let Beatrice know of it.

 O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man:
But nature never framed a woman's heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
Misprising what they look on, and her wit
Values itself so highly that to her
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
She is so self-endeared.

 Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
But she would spell him backward: if fairfaced,
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
If low, an agate very vilely cut;
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
If silent, why, a block moved with none.
So turns she every man the wrong side out
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.

 No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
It were a better death than die with mocks,
Which is as bad as die with tickling.

 No; rather I will go to Benedick
And counsel him to fight against his passion.
And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
How much an ill word may empoison liking.

 He is the only man of Italy,
Always excepted my dear Claudio.

 Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.

 Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.

 If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
                     [Exeunt Hero and Ursula.
               And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?

 Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?

 True! O God!

 O, God defend me! how am I beset!
What kind of catechising call you this?

 Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
With any just reproach?

 I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.

 They know that do accuse me; I know none:
If I know more of any man alive
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
Prove you that any man with me conversed
At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!

 And when I lived, I was your other wife:
[Unmasking. 
And when you loved, you were my other husband.

 Nothing certainer:
One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
And surely as I live, I am a maid.

 And here's another
Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
Containing her affection unto Benedick.

           What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
No glory lives behind the back of such.
And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
To bind our loves up in a holy band;
For others say thou dost deserve, and I
Believe it better than reportingly.[Exit.
            Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?

 Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!

 How now, cousin Hero!

 O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!

 No, truly not; although, until last night,
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.

                       Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.

         Will you go hear this news, signior?

 I answer to that name. What is your will?

 Why, no; no more than reason.

 Do not you love me?

 Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.

 They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.

 No, truly, but in friendly recompense.

Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.

 But are you sure
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?

 And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

 Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?

 Sure, I think so;
And therefore certainly it were not good
She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.

 Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.

 Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.

 O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
She can not be so much without true judgement—
Having so swift and excellent a wit
As she is prized to have—as to refuse
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.

 I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
For shape, for bearing, argument and valor,
Goes foremost in report through Italy.

 His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.

The danger of the task you undertake. Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
For the embracements even of Jove himself;
At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
The senate-house of planets all did sit,   
To knit in her their best perfections.
Music. Enter the Daughter of Antiochus. Prince Pericles,-- Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view 
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
And which, without desert, because thine eye
Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
That without covering, save yon field of stars,
Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
For going on death's net, whom none resist.  Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:
Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed. Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,
For that's an article within our law,
As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
Either expound now, or receive your sentence. Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found the meaning:
But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,              
Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
Your exposition misinterpreting,
We might proceed to cancel of your days;
Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
Forty days longer we do respite you;
If by which time our secret be undone,
This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
And until then your entertain shall be
As doth befit our honour and your worth. 
[Exeunt all but Pericles. He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
To have his head.
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
In such a loathed manner;
And therefore instantly this prince must die;
For by his fall my honour must keep high.
Who attends us there?

You are of our chamber, and our mind par- takes

And for your faithfulness we will advance you.

We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:

Because we bid it. Say, is it done? Enough.

Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste. As thou
Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot

[Exeunt all but Cerimon.
             Enter two Gentlemen. Gentlemen,
Why do you stir so early? O, you say well.       I hold it ever,
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
May the two latter darken and expend;
But immortality attends the former,        
Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever
Have studied physic, through which secret art,
By turning o'er authorities, I have,
Together with my practice, made familiar
To me and to my aid the blest infusions
That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
And I can speak of the disturbances
That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
A more content in course of true delight
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour, 
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
To please the fool and death. What is that? Set 't down, let's look upon 't. Whate'er it be,
'Tis wondrous heavy.   Wrench it open straight:
If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us. How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
Did the sea cast it up? Wrench it open;
Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.      As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse! Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured
With full bags of spices! A passport too!
Apollo, perfect me in the characters!
[Reads from a scroll.
'Here I give to understand,
If e'er this coffin drive a-land,
I, King Pericles, have lost              
This queen, worth all our mundane cost,
Who finds her, give her burying;
She was the daughter of a king:
Besides this treasure for a fee,
The gods requite his charity!'
If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart
That even cracks for woe!   This chanced to-night. Nay, certainly to-night;
For look how fresh she looks!   They were too rough
That threw her in the sea.   Make a fire within: 
Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.   
[Exit a Servant.
Death may usurp on nature many hours,
And yet the fire of life kindle again
The o'erpress'd spirits. I heard of an Egyptian
That had nine hours lien dead,
Who was by good appliance recovered.
Re-enter a Servant, with boxes, napkins, and fire.
Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.
The rough and woeful music that we have,
Cause it to sound, beseech you.
The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!  
The music there!--I pray you, give her air.
Gentlemen,
This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmth
Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced
Above five hours: see how she gins to blow
Into life's flower again! She is alive; behold,
Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels
Which Pericles hath lost,                   
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;
The diamonds of a most praised water
Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
Rare as you seem to be.
She moves. Hush, my gentle neighbours!
Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her.
Get linen: now this matter must be look'd to,
For her relapse is mortal. Come, come; 
And AEsculapius guide us!
[Exeunt, carrying her away. Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels,
Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
At your command. Know you the character? Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
Diana's temple is not distant far,
Where you may abide till your date expire.
Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
Shall there attend you. Noble sir,
If you have told Diana's altar true,
This is your wife. Upon this coast, I warrant you. Look to the lady; O, she's but o'er-joy'd.
Early in blustering morn this lady was
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,
Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her
Here in Diana's temple. Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is
Recovered. I will, my lord.
Beseech you, first go with me to my house,
Where shall be shown you all was found with her;
How she came placed here in the temple;
No needful thing omitted."
1024,cle.,Cleon,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-cle.," My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
And by relating tales of others' griefs,
See if 'twill teach us to forget our own? O Dionyza,                          
Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
They may awake their helps to comfort them.
I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears. This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
A city on whom plenty held full hand,
For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
And strangers ne'er beheld but wonder'd at;
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
Like one another's glass to trim them by:
Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
And not so much to feed on as delight;
All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
The name of help grew odious to repeat. But see what heaven can do!   By this our change,
These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
Were all too little to content and please,
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
As houses are defiled for want of use,
They are now starved for want of exercise:
Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
Must have inventions to delight the taste, 
Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
Thought nought too curious, are ready now
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
Is not this true?                                O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
And her prosperities so largely taste,
With their superflous riots, hear these tears!
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
                  Enter a Lord. Here.
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
For comfort is too far for us to expect. I thought as much.
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,
That may succeed as his inheritor;
And so in ours: some neighboring nation,
Taking advantage of our misery,
Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
To beat us down, the which are down already;
And make a conquest of unhappy me,
Whereas no glory's got to overcome.         Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
But bring they what they will and what they can,
What need we fear?
The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.
Go tell their general we attend him here,
To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,     
And what he craves. Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
If wars, we are unable to resist.
Enter PERICLES with Attendants.  The which when any shall not gratify,
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--
Your grace is welcome to our town and us. Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,
Yet glance full wanderingly on us. Fear not, my lord, but think
Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
Must in your child be thought on.   If neglection    
Should therein make me vile, the common body,
By you relieved, would force me to my duty:
But if to that my nature need a spur,
The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
To the end of generation! We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,
Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and
The gentlest winds of heaven. O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon! Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,
Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
To equal any single crown o' the earth
I' the justice of compare!   O villain Leonine!
Whom thou hast poison'd too:               
If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness
Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say
When noble Pericles shall demand his child? O, go to. Well, well,
Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
Do like this worst. To such proceeding
Who ever but his approbation added,
Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
From honorable sources. Heavens forgive it! Thou art like the harpy,
Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,
Seize with thine eagle's talons."

But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise. I'll do my best, sir.                  O, 'tis too true. Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it. O your sweet queen!
That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,
To have bless'd mine eyes with her! I have one myself,
Who shall not be more dear to my respect
Than yours, my lord. Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:
'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
A soldier to thy purpose.  How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
How chance my daughter is not with you?
 Do not
Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
A nurse of me.   Lord, how your favor's changed
With this unprofitable woe!
Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her. Come, come;
I love the king your father, and yourself,
With more than foreign heart. We every day
Expect him here: when he shall come and find
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
That excellent complexion, which did steal
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me;
I can go home alone. Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:
Remember what I have said. I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a  while:
Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:
What! I must have a care of you. Why, are you foolish?   Can it be undone? I think
You'll turn a child again. That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
Unless you play the pious innocent,
And for an honest attribute cry out
'She died by foul play.' Be one of those that think 
The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
And open this to Pericles.   I do shame
To think of what a noble strain you are,
And of how coward a spirit. Be it so, then:
Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
Nor none can know, Leonine being gone. 
She did distain my child, and stood between
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
But cast their gazes on Marina's face;
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
Not worth the time of day.   It pierced me thorough;
And though you call my course unnatural,
You not your child well loving, yet I find
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
Perform'd to your sole daughter. And as for Pericles,              
What should he say?   We wept after her hearse,
And yet we mourn: her monument
Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
In glittering golden characters express
A general praise to her, and care in us
At whose expense 'tis done. You are like one that superstitiously
Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:   
But yet I know you'll do as I advise.

CLEON; gives the Messenger a reward, and

and CLEON at another.
Good Helicane, that stay'd at home.
Not to eat honey like a drone
From others' labors; for though he strive
To killen bad, keep good alive;          
And to fulfil his prince' desire,
Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:
How Thaliard came full bent with sin
And had intent to murder him;
And that in Tarsus was not best
Longer for him to make his rest.
He, doing so, put forth to seas,
Where when men been, there's seldom ease;
For now the wind begins to blow;
Thunder above and deeps below         
Make such unquiet, that the ship
Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;
And he, good prince, having all lost,
By waves from coast to coast is tost:
All perishen of man, of pelf,
Ne aught escapen but himself;
Till fortune, tired with doing bad,
Threw him ashore, to give him glad:
And here he comes. What shall be next,
Pardon old Gower,--this longs the text. 
[Exit. Now sleep yslaked hath the rout;
No din but snores the house about,
Made louder by the o'er-fed breast
Of this most pompous marriage-feast.
The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
Now couches fore the mouse's hole;
And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,
E'er the blither for their drouth.
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,
Where, by the loss of maidenhead,       
A babe is moulded.   Be attent,
And time that is so briefly spent
With your fine fancies quaintly eche:
What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.
                 DUMB SHOW.
Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES, at one door,
with Attendants; a Messenger meets them,
kneels, and gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES 
shows it SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel
to him.   Then enter THAISA with child, with
LYCHORIDA a nurse.   The KING shows her
the letter; she rejoices:  she and PERICLES
takes leave of her father, and depart with 
LYCHORIDA and their Attendants.
Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest.]
By many a dern and painful perch
Of Pericles the careful search,
By the four opposing coigns
Which the world together joins,
Is made with all due diligence
That horse and sail and high expense     
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
Fame answering the most strange inquire,
To the court of King Simonides
Are letters brought, the tenor these:
Antiochus and his daughter dead;
The men of Tyrus on the head
Of Helicanus would set on
The crown of Tyre, but he will none:
The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
Says to 'em, if King Pericles             
Come not home in twice six moons,
He, obedient to their dooms,
Will take the crown. The sum of this,
Brought hither to Pentapolis,
Y-ravished the regions round,
And every one with claps can sound,
'Our heir-apparent is a king!
Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
His queen with child makes her desire--
Which who shall cross?--along to go:
Omit we all their dole and woe:
Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
On Neptune's billow; half the flood
Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood
Varies again; the grisled north
Disgorges such a tempest forth,
That, as a duck for life that dives,
So up and down the poor ship drives:   
The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
Does fall in travail with her fear:
And what ensues in this fell storm
Shall for itself itself perform.
I nill relate, action may
Conveniently the rest convey;
Which might not what by me is told.
In your imagination hold
This stage the ship, upon whose deck     
The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.
[Exit. Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
Welcomed and settled to his own desire.
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
Unto Diana there a votaress.
Now to Marina bend your mind,
Whom our fast-growing scene must find
At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd
In music, letters; who hath gain'd
Of education all the grace,
Which makes her both the heart and place
Of general wonder. But, alack,
That monster envy, oft the wrack
Of earned praise, Marina's life
Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
And in this kind hath our Cleon
One daughter, and a wench full grown,
Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
Hight Philoten: and it is said
For certain in our story, she
Would ever with Marina be:             
Be't when she weaved the sleided silk
With fingers long, small, white as milk;
Or when she would with sharp needle wound
The cambric, which she made more sound
By hurting it; or when to the lute
She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
That still records with moan; or when
She would with rich and constant pen
Vail to her mistress Dian; still
This Philoten contends in skill            
With absolute Marina: so
With the dove of Paphos might the crow
Vie feathers white. Marina gets
All praises, which are paid as debts,
And not as given. This so darks
In Philoten all graceful marks,
That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
A present murderer does prepare
For good Marina, that her daughter
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.   
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
And cursed Dionyza hath
The pregnant instrument of wrath
Prest for this blow. The unborn event
I do commend to your content:
Only I carry winged time
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;
Which never could I so convey,
Unless your thoughts went on my way. 
Dionyza does appear,
With Leonine, a murderer.
Exit. Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for 't;
Making, to take your imagination,
From bourn to bourn, region to region.
By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
To use one language in each several clime
Where our scenes seem to live.   I do beseech you
To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
The stages of our story. Pericles
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
Attended on by many a lord and knight,
To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
Advanced in time to great and high estate,
Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,
Old Helicanus goes along behind.
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile; 
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.DUMB SHOW.
Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his
   train; CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other.
 CLEON shows PERICLES the tomb; whereat
   PERICLES makes lamentation, puts on sack-cloth, and in a mighty passion departs. 
   Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA.
See how belief may suffer by foul show!
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks.   He swears
Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears, 
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit
The epitaph is for Marina writ
By wicked Dionyza.
[Reads the inscription on Marina's                      monument.
'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
Who wither'd in her spring of year.
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,
Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd: 
Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'
No visor does become black villany
So well as soft and tender flattery.
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
And bear his courses to be ordered
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
In her unholy service. Patience, then, 
And think you now are all in Mytilene.
[Exit. Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
Into an honest house, our story says.
She sings like one immortal, and she dances
As goddess-like to her admired lays;
Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes
Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
That even her art sisters the natural roses;
Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,   
Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
She gives the cursed bawd.   Here we her place;
And to her father turn our thoughts again,
Where we left him, on the sea.   We there him lost;
Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
And to him in his barge with fervor hies. 
In your supposing once more put your sight
Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
Where what is done in action, more, if might,
Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
Exit. Now our sands are almost run;
More a little, and then dumb.
This, my last boon, give me,
For such kindness must relieve me,
That you aptly will suppose
What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
The regent made in Mytilene
To greet the king. So he thrived,
That he is promised to be wived         
To fair Marina; but in no wise
Till he had done his sacrifice,
As Dian bade: whereto being bound,
The interim, pray you, all confound.
In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,
And wishes fall out as they're will'd.
At Ephesus, the temple see,
Our king and all his company.
That he can hither come so soon,
Is by your fancy's thankful doom.  
Exit.  In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last: 
In Helicanus may you well descry
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
In reverend Cerimon there well appears
The worth that learned charity aye wears:
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
Had spread their cursed deed, and honor'd name
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
That him and his they in his palace burn;
The gods for murder seemed so content
To punish them; although not done, but meant. 
So, on your patience evermore attending,
New joy wait on you!   Here our play has ending.
[Exit. "
1037,hel.,Helicanus,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-hel.," Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
They do abuse the king that flatter him:
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
The thing the which is flatter'd, but a spark, 
To which that blast gives heat and stronger
 glowing;
Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;
I cannot be much lower than my knees. An angry brow, dread lord. How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence
They have their nourishment? I have ground the axe myself;
Do you but strike the blow. To bear with patience
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.           Alas, sir! Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
Who either by public war or private treason
Will take away your life.
Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
Your rule direct to any; if to me,
Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be. We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
From whence we had our being and our birth. You shall not need, my fellow peers
 of Tyre,
Further to question me of your king's departure:
His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,
Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel. If further yet you will be satisfied,
Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,
He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.
Being at Antioch-- Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--     
Took some displeasure at him; at least he     judged so: 
And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;
So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
With whom each minute threatens life or death. Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome. We have no reason to desire it,
Commended to our master, not to us:
Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire, 
As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.
[Exeunt No, Escanes, know this of me,
Antiochus from incest lived not free:
For which, the most high gods not minding longer
To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,
Due to this heinous capital offence,
Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
When he was seated in a chariot
Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk, 
That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
Scorn now their hand should give them burial. And yet but justice; for though
This king were great, his greatness was no guard
To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward. With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords. Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love. For honor's cause, forbear your suffrages:
If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
A twelve month longer, let me entreat you to
Forbear the absence of your king;
If in which time expired, he not return,
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
But if I cannot win you to this love,
Go search like nobles, like noble subjects, 
And in your search spend your adventurous worth;
Whom if you find, and win unto return,
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown. Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.
[Exeunt. That he have his. Call up some gentlemen. Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;
I pray ye, greet them fairly.                 
The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go on board the barge.
Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords;
   with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors.  And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
And die as I would do. First, what is your place?           Sir,
Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;
A man who for this three months hath not spoken
To any one, nor taken sustenance
But to prorogue his grief. 'Twould be too tedious to repeat;
But the main grief springs from the loss
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.          You may;
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak
To any. Behold him.   Pericles discovered.
This was a goodly person,
Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
Drove him to this. It is in vain; he will not speak to you. Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit
That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness
We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you
That for our gold we may provision have,
Wherein we are not destitute for want,
But weary for the staleness. Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:
But, see, I am prevented.
Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA and a young Lady. She's a gallant lady. Calls my lord? I know not; but
Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene
Speaks nobly of her. Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
Did come to see you. My lord, I hear none. Sir? Hail, madam, and my queen!"

To do my work with haste. To satisfy my lady. My commission
Is not to reason of the deed, but do it. I am sworn,
And will dispatch.

And they have seized Marina. Let her go:
There's no hope she will return. I'll swear she's dead,
And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her, 
Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.

Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,
I made to it, to know of whence you are. I am the governor of this place you lie before. Upon what ground is his distemperature? May we not see him? Yet let me obtain my wish. Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!
Hail, royal sir!                                'Tis well bethought.

The island's side.

Of your king's sorrow. O, here is
The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!
Is't not a goodly presence? She's such a one, that, were I well assured
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.    
Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty
Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
As thy desires can wish. Come, let us leave her;
And the gods make her prosperous!         
[Marina sings. Mark'd he your music? See, she will speak to him. She would never tell
Her parentage; being demanded that,

Exit Dionyza.
Is this wind westerly that blows? When I was born, the wind was
north.  My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
But cried 'Good seamen!' to the sailors, galling
His kingly hands, haling ropes;
And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
That almost burst the deck. When I was born:
Never was waves nor wind more violent; 
And from the ladder-tackle washes off
A canvas-climber.   'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'
And with a dropping industry they skip
From stem   to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
The master calls, and trebles their confusion. What mean you? Why will you kill me? Why would she have me kill'd?
Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
I never did her hurt in all my life:
I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
To any living creature: believe me, la,
I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:
I trod upon a worm against my will,
But I wept for it. How have I offended, 
Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
Or my life imply her any danger? You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
You are well favor'd, and your looks foreshow
You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:
Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
And save poor me, the weaker. Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,
Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me  
For to seek my mother!         If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep, Untied I still my virgin knot will keep. Diana, aid my purpose!          If you were born to honor, show it now;
If put upon you, make the judgement good
That thought you worthy of it. For me,
That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune
Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,
Diseases have been sold dearer than physic.
O, that the gods
Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,
Though they did change me to the meanest bird
That flies i' the purer air! The good gods preserve you!      Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
Since they do better thee in their command.
Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
Of hell would not in reputation change:
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;
To the choleric fisting of every rogue
Thy ear is liable, thy food is such
As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs. Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty
Old receptacles, or common shores, of filth;
Serve by indenture to the common hangman:
Any of these ways are yet better than this;
For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,
Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods
Would safely deliver me from this place! 
Here, here's gold for thee.
If that thy master would gain by me,
Proclaim   that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast;
And I will undertake all these to teach.
I doubt not but this populous city will
Yield many scholars. Prove that I cannot, take me home again,    
And prostitute me to the basest groom
That doth frequent your house.  Sir, I will use
My utmost skill in his recovery,
Provided
That none but I and my companion maid
Be suffer'd to come near him. No, nor look'd on us. Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear. I am a maid,
My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
My derivation was from ancestors           
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
But time hath rooted out my parentage,
And to the world and awkward casualties
Bound me in servitude.   [Aside] I will desist;
But there is something glows upon my cheek,
And whispers in mine ear 'Go not till he speak.' I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,    
You would not do me violence. No, nor of any shores:
Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
No other than I appear. Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
You may discern the place. If I should tell my history, it would seem
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting. So indeed I did. Some such thing
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
Did warrant me was likely. My name is Marina. Patience, good sir,
Or here I'll cease. The name
Was given me by one that had some power,
My father, and a king. You said you would believe me;
But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
I will end here. Call'd Marina
For I was born at sea. My mother was the daughter of a king;
Who died the minute I was born,          
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
Deliver'd weeping. You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er. The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,
A crew of pirates came and rescued me;
Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
Whither will you have me?   Why do you weep?  It may be,
You think me an impostor: no, good faith;
I am the daughter to King Pericles,        
If good King Pericles be. First, sir, I pray,
What is your title? Is it no more to be your daughter than
To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
Thaisa was my mother, who did end
The minute I began. My heart
Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.   [Kneels to Thaisa."

[Exit."
1047,per.,Pericles,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-per.," I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
Think death no hazard in this enterprise. See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
Of every virtue gives renown to men!
Her face the book of praises, where is read
Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
Sorrow were ever razed, and testy wrath
Could never be her mild companion.
You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
That have inflamed desire in my breast     
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,
Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
As I am son and servant to your will,
To compass such a boundless happiness! That would be son to great Antiochus. Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath
 taught
My frail mortality to know itself,
And by those fearful objects to prepare
This body, like to them, to what I must;
For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
So I bequeath a happy peace to you         
And all good men, as every prince should do;
My riches to the earth from whence they came;
But my unspotted fire of love to you.     [To the daughter of Antiochus.
Thus ready for the way of life or death,
I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus. Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
Nor ask advice of any other thought
But faithfulness and courage.
              He reads the riddle.
I am no viper, yet I feed
On mother's flesh which did me breed.
I sought a husband, in which labor
I found that kindness in a father:
He's father, son, and husband mild;
I mother, wife, and yet his child.
How they may be, and yet in two,     
As you will live, resolve it you.
Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers
That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,
  [Takes hold of the hand of the Princess.
Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:
But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt;
For he's no man on whom perfections wait 
That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;
Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,
Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken;
But being play'd upon before your time,
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
Good sooth, I care not for you. Great king,                           
Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind,
Blows dust in others' eyes, to spread itself;
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts 
Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.
Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's their will;
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
It is enough you know; and it is fit,
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
All love the womb that their first being bred,
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head. How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
When what is done is like an hypocrite,
The which is good in nothing but in sight!
If it be true that I interpret false,
Then were it certain you were not so bad
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
Where now you're both a father and a son,
By your untimely claspings with your child,
Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;
And she an eater of her mother's flesh,   
By the defiling of her parent's bed;
And both like serpents are, who though they feed
On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame: 
Then, lest my life be cropp'd to keep you clear,
By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.
[Exit.
             Re-enter ANTIOCHUS. Let none disturb us.--Why should this change of thoughts,
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,
Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here:
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.   
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
That have their first conception by mis-dread,
Have after-nourishment and life by care;
And what was first but fear what might be done,
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
And so with me: the great Antiochus,
'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
Since he's so great can make his will his act,
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
Nor boots it me to say I honor him,      
If he suspect I may dishonor him:
And what may make him   blush in being known,
He'll stop the course by which it might be known;
With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;
Our men be vanquish'd' ere they do resist,
And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
Which care of them, not pity of myself,
Who am no more but as the tops of trees, 
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
And punish that before that he would punish.
     Enter HELICANUS, with other LORDS. All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook
What shipping and what lading's in our haven,
And then return to us.   Exeunt Lords.
Helica`nus, thou   
Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks? If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
How durst thy tongue move anger to our face? Thou know'st I have power
To take thy life from thee. Rise, prithee, rise.
Sit down: thou art no flatterer:             
I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid!
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
Who by thy wisdom   makest a prince thy servant,
What wouldst thou have me do? Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
That minister'st a potion unto me
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,       
Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,
>From whence an issue I might propagate,

Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou know'st this,
'Tis tme to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
Which fear so grew in me, I hither fled, 
Under the covering of a careful night,
Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
That I should open to the listening air
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him; 
When all, for mine, if I may call offence,
Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
Who now reprovest me for it,-- Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
And finding little comfort to relieve them,
I thought it princely charity to grieve them. I do not doubt thy faith;            
But should he wrong my liberties in my absence? Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus
Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;
And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
The care I had and have of subjects' good
On thee I lay, whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:  
But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,
That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.
[Exeunt. Lord governor, for so we hear you are,
Let not our ships and number of our men
Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,
And seen the desolation of your streets:
Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears, 
But to relieve them of their heavy load;
And these our ships, you happily may think
Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,
Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,
And give them life whom hunger starved half dead. Arise, I pray you, rise:
We do not look for reverence, but for love, 
And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men. Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.
[Exeunt. Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man
Is but a substance that must yield to you;
And I, as fits my nature, do obey you:
Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath
Nothing to think on but ensuing death:
Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;
And having thrown him from your watery grave, 
Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
             Enter three Fishermen.   How from the finny subject of  the sea 
These fishers tell the infirmities of men;
And from their watery empire recollect
All that may men approve or men detect!
Peace be at your labor, honest fishermen.  A man whom both the waters and the     wind, 
In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball
For them to play upon, entreats you pity him; 
He asks of you, that never used to beg.  What I have been I have forgot to     know; 
But what I am, want teaches me to think on:
A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are     chill, 
And have no more of life than may suffice
To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;
Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,
For that I am a man, pray see me buried.    How well this honest mirth becomes their labor!     An armor, friends!   I pray you, let me     see it. 
Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,
Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;
And though it was mine own, part of my heritage, 
Which my dead father did bequeath to me,
With this strict charge, even as he left his life.
'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield
'Twixt me and death;'--and pointed to this     brace;-- 
'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity-- 
The which the gods protect thee from!--may     defend thee.' 
It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;
Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,
Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:
I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,
Since I have here my father's gift in's will. To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
For it was sometime target to a king;
I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
And for his sake I wish the having of it;
And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's     court, 
Where with it I may appear a gentleman;
And if that ever my low fortune's better,
I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your     debtor.  I'll show the virtue I have borne in     arms.  Believe't, I will.
By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;
And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,
This jewel holds his building on my arm:
Unto thy value I will mount myself
Upon a courser, whose delightful steps
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided
Of a pair of bases. Then honor be but a goal to my     will, 
This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.
[Exeunt. 'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit. Some other is more fit. You are right courteous knights. By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,
These cates resist me, she but thought upon. Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,
Which tells me in that glory once he was;
Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,
And he the sun, for them to reverence;     
None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:
Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,
The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:
Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,
He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
And gives them what he will, not what they crave. I thank him, I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely. A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;      
My education been in arts and arms;
Who, looking for adventures in the world,
Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
And after shipwreck driven upon this shore. In those that practise them they are, my lord. I am at your grace's pleasure. All fortune to the good Simonides! It is your grace's pleasure to commend;
Not my desert. The worst of all her scholars, my good lord. A most virtuous princess. As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair. I am unworthy for her schoolmaster. What's here?
A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
'Tis the king's subtilty to have my life.
O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
A stranger and distressed gentleman,
That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,
But bent all offices to honor her. By the gods, I have not:
Never did thought of mine levy offence;
Nor never did my actions yet commence
A deed might gain her love or your displeasure. Traitor! Even in his throat--unless it be the king--
That calls me traitor, I return the lie. My actions are as noble as my thoughts,
That never relish'd of a base descent.       
I came unto your court for honor's cause,
And not to be a rebel to her state;
And he that otherwise accounts of me,
This sword shall prove he's honor's enemy. Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,
Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
Did e'er solicit, or my hand subscribe
To any syllable that made love to you.    Even as my life my blood that fosters it. Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,
Which wash forth both heaven and hell; and thou, that hast
Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
Having call'd them from the deep!   O, still
Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench
Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes!   O, how, Lychorida,
How does my queen?   Thou stormest venomously;
Wilt thou spit all thyself?   The seaman's whistle
Is as a whisper in the ears of death,
Unheard.   Lychorida!--Lucina, O           
Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle
To those that cry by night, convey thy deity
Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs
Of my queen's travails!
     Enter LYCHORIDA, with an Infant.Now, Lychorida! How, how, Lychorida! O you gods!
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,
And snatch them straight away?   We here below
Recall not what we give, and therein may
Use honor with you.        Now, mild may be thy life!
For a more blustrous birth had never babe:
Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for
Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
That ever was prince's child.   Happy what follows!      
Thou hast as chiding a nativity
As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,
To herald thee from the womb: even at the first
Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,
With all thou canst find here. Now, the good     gods 
Throw their best eyes upon't!
               Enter two Sailors. Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;
It hath done to me the worst.  Yet, for the love        
Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,
I would it would be quiet.   A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;
No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements
Forgot thee utterly; nor have I time         
To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight
Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;
Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale
And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,
Lying with simple shells.   O Lychorida,
Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,
My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander
Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe
Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say     
A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.
     [Exit Lychorida.  Thither, gentle mariner,
Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it? O, make for Tarsus!
There will I visit Cleon, for the babe   
Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it
At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner:
I'll bring the body presently.
[Exeunt. Most honour'd Cleon, I must needs be gone;
My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
In a litigious peace. You, and your lady,
Take from my heart all thankfulness! The gods
Make up the rest upon you! We cannot but obey
The powers above us. Could I rage and roar
As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end     
Must be as 'tis.   My gentle babe Marina, whom,
For she was born at sea, I have named so, here
I charge your charity withal, leaving her
The infant of your care; beseeching you
To give her princely training, that she may be
Mannered as she is born. I believe you;
Your honour and your goodness teach me to't,
Without your vows.   Till she be married, madam,
By bright Diana, whom we honour, all
Unscissar'd shall this hair of mine remain,
Though I show ill in't. So I take my leave.
Good madam, make me blessed in your care
In bringing up my child. Madam, my thanks and prayers. I will embrace
Your offer.   Come, dearest madam. O, no tears,
Lychorida, no tears:
Look to your little mistress, on whose grace 
You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.
[Exeunt. Hum, ha! My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--
To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you? I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
You are like something that--What country-woman?
Here of these shores? I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like     
And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;
Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
The more she gives them speech. Where do you live? Where were you bred?
And how achieved you these endowments, which
You make more rich to owe? Prithee, speak: 
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st
Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace
For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will believe thee,
And make my senses credit thy relation
To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st
Like one I loved indeed.   What were thy friends?
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
From good descending? Report thy parentage.   I think thou said'st  
Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
And   that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
If both were open'd. Tell thy story;
If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
How lost thou them?   Thy name, my most kind virgin? 
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me. O, I am mock'd,
And thou by some incensed god sent hither
To make the world to laugh at me. Nay, I'll be patient.
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
To call thyself Marina. How! a king's daughter? 
And call'd Marina? But are you flesh and blood?
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
Motion!   Well; speak on. Where were you born?
And wherefore call'd Marina? At sea! what mother? O, stop there a little!
[Aside]This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:
My daughter's buried.   Well: where were you bred?
I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
And never interrupt you. I will believe you by the syllable
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?   Ho, Helicanus! Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,
What this maid is, or what is like to be,
That thus hath made me weep? O Helicanus, strike me, honor'd sir;
Give me a gash, put me to present pain;
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
O'erbear the shores of my mortality,
And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,
Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
And found at sea again!  O Helicanus,
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud  
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.
What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,
For truth can never be confirm'd enough,
Though doubts did ever sleep. I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
Thou hast been godlike perfect,
The heir of kingdoms and another like
To Pericles thy father.                      Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.
Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;
She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;
When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
She is thy very princess. Who is this?  I embrace you.
Give me my robes.   I am wild in my beholding.
O heavens bless my girl!   But, hark, what music?
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
How sure you are my daughter.   But, what music? None!                               
The music of the spheres! List, my Marina. Rarest sounds!   Do ye not hear? Most heavenly music!
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.  [Sleeps. Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,
I will obey thee. Helicanus!
   Re-enter HELICANUS, LYSIMACHUS, and
            MARINA. My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
The inhospitable Cleon; but I am
For other service first: toward Ephesus
Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.
[To Lysimachus] Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
And give you gold for such provision
As our intents will need? You shall prevail,
Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems
You have been noble towards her. Come, my Marina.  Exeunt. Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
I here confess myself the king of Tyre;
Who, frighted from my country, did wed
At Pentapols the fair Thaisa.
At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,
Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years
He sought to murder: but her better stars
Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore
Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
Made known herself my daughter. What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen! Reverend appearer, no;
I threw her overboard with these very arms. 'Tis most certain.  May we see them? The voice of dead Thaisa! Immortal Dian! This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness 
Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,
That on the touching of her lips I may
Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried
A second time within these arms. Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;
Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina
For she was yielded there. You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre, 
I left behind an ancient substitute:
Can you remember what I call'd the man?
I have named him oft. Still confirmation:
Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.
Now do I long to hear how you were found;
How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
Besides the gods, for this great miracle. Reverend sir,
The gods can have no mortal officer
More like a god than you. Will you deliver
How this dead queen re-lives? Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision!   I
Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa, 
This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,
This ornament
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,
To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify. Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.  [Exeunt."

1056,sim.,Simonides,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-sim.," Are the knights ready to begin the triumph? Return them, we are ready; and our daughter,
In honor of whose birth these triumphs are,
Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat
For men to see, and seeing wonder at.
          [Exit a Lord. It's fit it should be so; for princes are
A model, which heaven makes like to itself:
As jewels lose their glory if neglected,
So princes their renowns if not respected.
'Tis now your honor, daughter, to explain
The labor of each knight in his device. Who is the first that doth prefer himself? He loves you well that holds his life of you.
[The Second Knight passes over.
Who is the second that presents himself? And what's the third? What is the fourth? Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
[The Fifth Knight passes over. And what's
The sixth and last, the which the knight himself     
With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd? A pretty moral;
From the dejected state wherein he is,
He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish. Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
The outward habit by the inward man.
But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw
Into the gallery.              [Exeunt.
[Great shouts within, and all cry 'The mean knight!' Knights,
To say you're welcome were superfluous.
To place upon the volume of your deeds,
As in a title-page, your worth in arms,
Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
Since every worth in show commends itself.
Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
You are princes and my guests. Call it by what you will, the day is yours;
And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,
To make some good, but others to exceed;
And you are her labor'd scholar.   Come, queen o' the feast,--
For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:
Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace. Your presence glads our days; honor we love;
For who hates honor hates the gods above. Sit, sir, sit. He's but a country gentleman;
Has done no more than other knights have done;
Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass. What, are you merry, knights? Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--     
As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--
We drink this health to you. Yet pause awhile:
Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
As if the entertainment in our court
Had not a show might countervail his worth.
Note it not you, Thaisa? O, attend, my daughter:
Princes in this should live like gods above,
Who freely give to every one that comes   
To honor them:
And princes not doing so are like to gnats,
Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,
Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him. How!                                 
Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else. And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,
Of whence he is, his name and parentage. Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,              
And will awake him from his melancholy.
Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
And waste the time, which looks for other revels.
Even in your armors, as you are address'd,
Will very well become a soldier's dance.
I will not have excuse, with saying this
Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads
Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
            [The Knights dance.
So, this was well ask'd, 'twas so well perform'd.
Come, sir;                                    
Here is a lady which wants breathing too:
And I have heard, you knights of Tyre
Are excellent in making ladies trip;
And that their measures are as excellent. O, that's as much as you would be denied
Of your fair courtesy.            [The Knights and Ladies dance.Unclasp, unclasp:
Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well,
[To Per.] But you the best.   Pages and lights,
to conduct 
These knights unto their several lodgings! 
[To Per.] Yours, sir,                   
We have given order to be next our own. Princes, it is too late to talk of love;
And that's the mark I know you level at:
Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
To-morrow all for speeding do their best.
[Exeunt. Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
A married life.
Her reason to herself is only known,
Which yet from her by no means can I get. 'Faith, by no means; she hath so strictly tied
Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.
One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery; 
This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd,
And on her virgin honour will not break it. So,
They are well dispatch'd; now to my daughter's letter:
She tells me here, she'll wed the stranger knight,
Or never more to view nor day nor light.
'Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine;
I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,
Not minding whether I dislike or no!       
Well, I do commend her choice;
And will no longer have it delay'd.
Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.
                Enter PERICLES. To you as much, sir!   I am beholding to you
For your sweet music this last night: I do
Protest my ears were never better fed
With such delightful pleasing harmony. Sir, you are music's master.  Let me ask you one thing:
What do you think of my daughter, sir? And she is fair too, is she not? Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you;
Ay, so well, that you must be her master,
And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it. She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.  Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art
A villain.                                       Traitor, thou liest. Ay, traitor. Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage. No?
Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.
                 Enter THAISA. Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?
 [Aside]
I am glad on't with all my heart.--
I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.
Will you, not having my consent,
Bestow your love and your affections
Upon a stranger? [Aside] who, for aught I know, 
May be, nor can I think the contrary,
As great in blood as I myself.--            
Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame
Your will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,
Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--
Man and wife:
Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it     too: 
And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;
And for a further grief,--God give you joy!--
What, are you both pleased? What, are you both agreed?          It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed;
And then with what haste you can get you to bed.
[Exeunt."
1057,thai.,Thaisa,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-thai.," It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express
My commendations great, whose merit's less. Which, to preserve mine honor, I'll perform.
Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his
Squire presents his shield to the Princess. A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun:     
The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.' A prince of Macedon, my royal fa- ther;
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is an arm'd knight that's conquered by a lady;
The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'
[The Third Knight passes over. The third of Antioch;
And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'      
[The Fourth Knight passes over. A burning torch that's turned upside down;
The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.' The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,
Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'
[The Sixth Knight, Pericles, passes over. He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.' But you, my knight and guest;
To whom this wreath of victory I give,     
And crown you king of this day's happiness. By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
All viands that I eat do seem unsavory, 
Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman. To me he seems like diamond to glass. What is it
To me, my father? Alas, my father, it befits not me
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
He may my proffer take for an offence,
Since men take women's gifts for impudence. Now, by the gods, he could not please me better. The king my father, sir, has drunk to you. Wishing it so much blood unto your life. And further he desires to know of you,
Of whence you are, your name and parentage. He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,
A gentleman of Tyre,
Who only by misfortune of the seas
Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore. Why, sir, say if you had,
Who takes offence at that would make me glad? Yes, if you love me, sir. O dear Diana,
Where am I?   Where's my lord?   What world is this? It is my lord's.
That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,
Even on my eaning time; but whether there
Deliver'd, by the holy gods,
I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
A vestal livery will I take me to,            
And never more have joy. My recompense is thanks, that's all;
Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
[Exeunt.  Voice and favor!
You are, you are--O royal Pericles!  [Faints. O, let me look!
If he be none of mine, my sanctity
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear, 
But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,
Are you not Pericles?   Like him you spake,
Like him   you are: did you not name a tempest,
A birth, and death? That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
And drown'd. Now I know you better.
When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
The king my father gave you such a ring.  [Shows a ring. Blest, and mine own! I know you not. 'Twas Helicanus then. Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,
Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can  
From first to last resolve you. Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
My father's dead."
1058,thal.,Thaliard,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-thal.," Doth your highness call?  My lord,
'Tis done. My lord,
If I can get him within my pistol's length,
I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.  How! the king gone! What from Antioch? Well, I perceive
I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:
He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.
I'll present myself.   Peace to the lords of Tyre!                  From him I come
With message unto princely Pericles;
But since my landing I have understood
Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,
My message must return from whence it came."

1064,king.,FERDINAND,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-king.," Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
The endeavour of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
That war against your own affections
And the huge army of the world's desires,--
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Our court shall be a little Academe,
Still and contemplative in living art.
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
My fellow-scholars and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this schedule here:
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein:
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.

 Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.

 Why, that to know, which else we should not know.

 Ay, that is study's god-like recompense.

 These be the stops that hinder study quite
And train our intellects to vain delight.

 How well he's read, to reason against reading!

 Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.

 Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.

 How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
 What say you, lords? why, this was quite forgot.

 We must of force dispense with this decree;
She must lie here on mere necessity.

 Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
With a refined traveller of Spain;
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
One whom the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
For interim to our studies shall relate
In high-born words the worth of many a knight
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.

                     And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
My lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
And go we, lords, to put in practice that
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.

 Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

 You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.

 Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.

 Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

 Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

 Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.

 Madam, your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we, as neither have,
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
If then the king your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear princess, were not his requests so far
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
And go well satisfied to France again.

 I do protest I never heard of it;
And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
Or yield up Aquitaine.

 Satisfy me so.

 It shall suffice me: at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour without breach of honour may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
But here without you shall be so received
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
To-morrow shall we visit you again.

 Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
Exit. 
  So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;
Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe,
Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
And they thy glory through my grief will show:
But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:
Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?

Steps aside 
What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.

 In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!

 And I mine too, good Lord!

 Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
You chide at him, offending twice as much;
You do not love Maria; Longaville
Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
I have been closely shrouded in this bush
And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
Ay me! says one;   Jove! the other cries;
One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
 To Long.
You would for paradise break faith and troth;
 To Dum.
And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
What will Biron say when that he shall hear
Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
For all the wealth that ever I did see,
I would not have him know so much by me.

 Too bitter is thy jest.
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?

 Soft! whither away so fast
A true man or a thief that gallops so?

 What present hast thou there?

 What makes treason here?

 If it mar nothing neither,
The treason and you go in peace away together.

 Biron, read it over.
Giving him the paper.
Where hadst thou it?

 Where hadst thou it ?

 How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?

 What?

 Hence, sirs; away!

 What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?

 What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
She an attending star, scarce seen a light.

 By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.

 O paradox ! Black is the badge of hell,
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.

 And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.

 'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.

 No devil will fright thee then so much as she.

 But what of this? are we not all in love?

 Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.

 Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field !

 And win them too: therefore let us devise
Some entertainment for them in their tents.

 Away, away! no time shall be omitted
That will betime, and may by us be fitted.

 Say to her, we have measured many miles
To tread a measure with her on this grass.

 Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.

 Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.

 Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?

 Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.

 But your legs should do it.

 Why take we hands, then?

 More measure of this measure; be not nice.

 Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?

 That can never be.

 If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.

 I am best pleased with that.

They converse apart.
 Farewell, mad wenches; You have simple wits.

 Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?

 That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.

 A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
That put Armado's page out of his part!

 All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!

 Construe my speeches better, if you may.

 We came to visit you, and purpose now
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.

 Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.

 O, you have lived in desolation here,
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.

 How, madam! Russians!

 We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.

 Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
Some fair excuse.

 Madam, I was.

 I was, fair madam.

 That more than all the world I did respect her.

 Upon mine honour, no.

 Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.

 What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
I never swore this lady such an oath.

 My faith and this the princess I did give:
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.

 Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.

 I say they shall not come.

 And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
These four will change habits, and present the other five.

 You are deceived; 'tis not so.

 The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
         Enter COSTARD, for Pompey.
 Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.

 I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.

  Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.

 The extreme parts of time extremely forms
All causes to the purpose of his speed,
And often at his very loose decides
That which long process could not arbitrate:
And though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
The holy suit which fain it would convince,
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.

 Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
Grant us your loves.

 If this, or more than this, I would deny,
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest.
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.


 No, madam; we will bring you on your way.

 Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
And then 'twill end.

 Call them forth quickly; we will do so.

"
1065,biron.,BIRON,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-biron.," I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances;
As, not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day--
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

 Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your grace
And stay here in your court for three years' space.

 By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study? let me know.

 Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

 Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know:
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Study to break it and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

 Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
As, painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others' books.
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.

 The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.

 Fit in his place and time.

 Something then in rhyme.

 Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows.
So you, to study now it is too late,
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.

 No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.

    This article, my liege, yourself must break;
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
A maid of grace and complete majesty--
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
Therefore this article is made in vain,
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.

 So study evermore is overshot:
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should,
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.

 Necessity will make us forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born,
Not by might mastered but by special grace:
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
So to the laws at large I write my name:Subscribes.
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
But is there no quick recreation granted?

 Armado is a most illustrious wight,
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.

          I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.

 Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

  You must not be so quick.

 Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

     Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.

     Now, God save thy life!

 I cannot stay thanksgiving.
Retiring.

      Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.

 Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

   Why, villain, thou must know first.

 The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
Giving him a shilling. 
 And I, forsooth, in love!   I, that
have been love's whip;
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
Sole imperator and great general
Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
And I to be a corporal of his field,
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright. being a watch,
But being watch'd that it may still go right!
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
And, among three, to love the worst of all;
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
[Exit.
   Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
 Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper. 
  One drunkard loves another of the name.

 I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.

 O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
Disfigure not his slop.

 This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.

 All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky,
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'er-eye.
More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
         Enter DUMAIN, with a paper.
Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!

 O most profane coxcomb!

 By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.

 An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.

 Stoop, I say;
Her shoulder is with child.

 Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.

 Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?

 A fever in your blood! why, then incision
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!

 Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.

 Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.

Advancing.
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears;
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
But I a beam do find in each of three.
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
And, gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? all about the breast:
A caudle, ho!

 Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in;
I am betray'd, by keeping company
With men like men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
In pruning me?   When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb?

 I post from love: good lover, let me go.
 Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD. 
 A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.

 Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were born to do me shame.
Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.

 That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.

 True, true; we are four.
Will these turtles be gone?

 Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.

 Did they, quoth you?   Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
That is not blinded by her majesty?

 My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
Where several worthies make one dignity,
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
Fie, painted rhetoric!   O, she needs it not:
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.

 Is ebony like her?  O wood divine!
A  wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
If that she learn not of her eye to look:
No face is fair that is not full so black.

 Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
For native blood is counted painting now;
And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

 Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.

 I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.

 O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!

 Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.

 'Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto,
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Have found the ground of study's excellence
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
[From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;
They are the ground, the books, the academes
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.]
Why, universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
As motion and long-during action tires
The sinewy vigor of the traveller.
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
And study too, the causer of your vow;
For where is any author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is:
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,

Do we not likewise see our learning there?
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with ?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain;
But, with the motion of all elements,
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails;
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain and nourish all the world:
Else none at all in aught proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear,
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths,
It is religion to be thus forsworn,
For charity itself fulfils the law,
And who can sever love from charity?

 Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
In conflict that you get the sun of them.

 First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them,
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

 Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
And justice always whirls in equal measure:
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

Exeunt.
 Their eyes, villain, their eyes.

 Once to behold, rogue.

 Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
Exit Moth. 
 Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

 Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.

 We number nothing that we spend for you:
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
That we may do it still without accompt.
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
That we, like savages, may worship it.

 White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

 Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
There's half a dozen sweets.

 One word in secret.

 Thou grievest my gall.

 Therefore meet.

They converse apart.
 By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!

 This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
And utters it again when God doth please:
He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
A mean most meanly; and in ushering
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
This is the flower that smiles on every one,
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
And consciences, that will not die in debt,
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.

 See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou
Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?
 Re-enter the Princess, ushered by BOYET; ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE. 
 This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
By light we lose light: your capacity
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.

 I am a fool, and full of poverty.

 O, I am yours, and all that I possess!

 I cannot give you less.

 Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?

 Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
Can any face of brass hold longer out?
Here stand I: lady, dart thy skill at me;
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
I do forswear them; and I here protest,
By this white glove,--how white the hand, God knows!--
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

 Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
These lords are visited; you are not free,
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.

 Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.

 Peace! for I will not have to do with you.

 Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.

 Neither of either; I remit both twain.
I see the trick on't: here was a consent
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
The ladies did change favours: and then we,
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
We are again forsworn, in will and error.
Much upon this it is: and might not you

To Boyet.
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
Wounds like a leaden sword.

 Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
                 Enter COSTARD.
Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.

 What, are there but three?

 And three times thrice is nine.

 Is not nine.

  How much is it?

 Art thou one of the Worthies?

 Go bid them prepare.

 We are shame-proof, my lord: and 'tis some policy
To have one show worse than the king's and his company.

 A right description of our sport, my lord.
                 Enter ARMADO.
  There is five in the first show.

 Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.

 Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends with thee.

 My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
    Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander.
 Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.

 Pompey the Great,--

 Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.

 A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?

 Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.

 Because thou hast no face.

 A Death's face in a ring.

 Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.

 Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.

 False; we have given thee faces.

 An thou wert a lion, we would do so.

 For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!

  This cannot be Hector.

 A lemon.

     Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.

 Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
And by these badges understand the king.
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humors
Even to the opposed end of our intents:
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
As love is full of unbefitting strains,
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance:
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours, the error that love makes
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
By being once false for ever to be true
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

 And what to me, my love? and what to me?


 Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
What humble suit attends thy answer there:
Impose some service on me for thy love.

 To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be; it is impossible:
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.

 A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.

 Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
Might well have made our sport a comedy.

 That's too long for a play.
                Re-enter ARMADO.
"
1066,long.,LONGAVILLE,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-long.," I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.

 You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.

 He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.

    Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
And so to study, three years is but short.
   Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD.
   I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?

 Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.

     Am I the first that have been perjured so?

 I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move.
O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.

 This same shall go.
Reads.
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
To lose an oath to win a paradise?

 By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.
Steps aside. 
 And I had mine!

 Dumain, thy love is far from charity,
That in love's grief desirest society:
You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.

 It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.

 And since her time are colliers counted bright.

 Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.

 O, some authority how to proceed;
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.

 Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?

 I know the reason, lady, why you ask.

 You have a double tongue within your mask,
And would afford my speechless vizard half.

 A calf, fair lady!

 Let's part the word.

 Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.

 One word in private with you, ere I die.

 The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.

 His leg is too big for Hector's.

 Stuck with cloves.

 That columbine.

  So did our looks.

 What says Maria?

 I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.

"
1067,dum.,DUMAIN,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-dum.," My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
With all these living in philosophy.

 Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!

 How follows that?

 In reason nothing.

 Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?

 A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
Exit. 
 O most divine Kate!

 By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!

 Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.

 As upright as the cedar.

 As fair as day.

 O that I had my wish!

 I would forget her; but a fever she
Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.

 Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.

 On a day--alack the day!--
Love, whose month is ever May,
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air:
Through the velvet leaves the wind,
All unseen, can passage find;
That the lover, sick to death,
Wish himself the heaven's breath.
Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
Air, would I might triumph so!
But, alack, my hand is sworn
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
Do not call it sin in me,
That I am forsworn for thee;
Thou for whom Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were;
And deny himself for Jove,
Turning mortal for thy love.
This will I send and something else more plain,
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
For none offend where all alike do dote.

 It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
Gathering up the pieces. 
 Now the number is even.

 To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.

 Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.

 I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.

 O vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.

 Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.

 Some salve for perjury.

 Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?

 Fair lady,--

 Please it you,
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.

They converse apart.
 Let us confess and turn it to a jest.

 The Great.

 A Judas!

 Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.

 The more shame for you, Judas.

 The head of a bodkin.

 The carved-bone face on a flask.

 Ay, and in a brooch of lead.

 For the latter end of his name.

  More calf, certain.

  A gilt nutmeg.

 No, cloven.

 That mint.

  He may not by the yard.

 Most rare Pompey!

      Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.

 But what to me, my love? but what to me?
A wife?

 O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?

 I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.

 The worthy knight of Troy.

"
1068,boyet.,BOYET,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-boyet.," Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
Consider who the king your father sends,
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you.

 Proud of employment, willingly I go.

 Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
To let you enter his unpeopled house.

Here comes Navarre.
Enter KING, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants. 
 So please your grace, the packet is not come
Where that and other specialties are bound:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

 The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.

 A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

 She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.

      Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
Exit Biron. 
 And every jest but a word.

 I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

 And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

 So you grant pasture for me.
Offering to kiss her.
 Belonging to whom?

 If my observation, which very seldom lies,
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

 With that which we lovers entitle affected.

 Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
To the court of his eye, peeping through desire:
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

 But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosed.
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.

 Do you hear, my mad wenches?

 What then, do you see?

 You are too hard for me.

Exeunt.
 I know not; but I think it was not he.

 Do not curst wives hold that selfsovereignty
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
Lords o'er their lords?

 Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
                Enter COSTARD.
 I am bound to serve.
This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
It is writ to Jaquenetta.

 Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
Submissive fall his princely feet before,
And he from forage will incline to play:
But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.

 I am much deceived but I remember the style.

 This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
To the prince and his bookmates.

 Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?

 Ay, my continent of beauty.

 My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
Finely put on!

 And who is your deer?

 But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?

  An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
An I cannot, another can.

 A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.

 An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.

 I fear too much rubbing.   Good night, my good owl.

Exeunt Boyet and Maria.
 O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?

 Prepare, madam, prepare!
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.

 Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The king and his companions: warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
And overheard what you shall overhear,
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
Action and accent did they teach him there;
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out;
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
A better speech was never spoke before;
Another, with his finger and his thumb,
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
To check their folly, passion's solemn tears.

 They do, they do; and are apparell'd thus,
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
And every one his love-feat will advance
Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
By favors several which they did bestow.

 Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part.

 The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
The Ladies mask. 
Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; the King, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked.

 Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.

 True; out indeed.

 They will not answer to that epithet;
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'

 What would you with the princess?

 Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

 She says, you have it, and you may be gone.

 They say, that they have measured many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass.

 If to come hither you have measured miles,
And many miles, the princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile.

 She hears herself.

 The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
As is the razor's edge invisible.
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
Above the sense of sense; so sensible
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.

 Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.

 Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
Immediately they will again be here
In their own shapes; for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity.

 They will, they will, God knows,
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
Therefore change favors; and, when they repair,
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.

 Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.

 Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.

 Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
Command me any service to her thither?

 I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
Exit. 
 Full merrily
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.

 You lie, you are not he.

 With libbard's head on knee.

 Your nose says, no, you are not; for it stands too right.

 Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.

 To make Judas hang himself.

 A cittern-head.

 The pommel of Caesar's falchion.

 Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?

   No; he is best indued in the small.

 Loves her by the foot.

  By heart and in heart, boy.

 What wilt thou prove?

  Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.

    I say lead is slow.

 Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
I shoot thee at the swain.

 A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
My herald is return'd.
Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD.
 Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.

  No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
I will example it:

The fox, the ape and the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.

 The fox, the ape, the humble-bee,
Were still at odds, being but three.

 Until the goose came out of door,
Staying the odds by adding four.

 Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?

  We will talk no more of this matter.

  I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.

 What meanest thou?

  By the north pole, I do challenge thee.

  THE SONG.
SPRING.
When daisies pied and violets blue
And lady-smocks all silver-white
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
Cuckoo;

Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
And maidens bleach their summer smocks,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
Cuckoo;

Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!

WINTER.
When icicles hang by the wall
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
And Tom bears logs into the hall
And milk comes frozen home in pail,
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,

Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
When all aloud the wind doth blow
And coughing drowns the parson's saw
And birds sit brooding in the snow
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,

Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

     If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove;
Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bow'd.
Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend:
If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.

     A most singular and choice epithet.

"
1077,prin.,The PRINCESS of France,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-prin.," Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
Till painful study shall outwear three years,
No woman may approach his silent court:
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
Importunes personal conference with his grace:
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.

 All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
Exit Boyet.
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?

 Know you the man?

 Some merry mocking lord, belike; is 't so?

 Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
Who are the rest?

 God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
That every one her own hath garnished
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?

 Now, what admittance, lord?

  I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.

 Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.

 Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.

 Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.
But pardon me, I am too sudden-bold:
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.

 You will the sooner, that I were away;
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.

 You do the king my father too much wrong
And wrong the reputation of your name,
In so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

 We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father.

 Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!

 It was well done of you to take him at his word.

 Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
This civil war of wits were much better used
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.

   Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.

 Was that the king, that spurr'd his horse so hard
Against the steep uprising of the hill?

 Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
On Saturday we will return to France.
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
That we must stand and play the murderer in?

 I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.

 What, what? first praise me and again say no?
O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!

 Nay, never paint me now:
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
Fair payment for foul words is more than due.

 See, see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
And shooting well is then accounted ill.
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
Not wounding, pity would not let me do't:
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
And out of question so it is sometimes,
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
We bend to that the working of the heart;
As I for praise alone now seek to spill
The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.

 Only for praise: and praise we may afford
To any lady that subdues a lord.

   What's your will, sir? what's your will?

 O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
Stand aside, good bearer.   Boyet, you can carve;
Break up this capon.

 We will read it, I swear.
Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.

 What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?

 Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.

 Thou fellow, a word:
Who gave thee this letter?

 To whom shouldst thou give it?

 From which lord to which lady?

 Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
 [To Ros.[
Here, sweet, put up this; 'twill be thine another day.

[Exeunt Princess and train.
 Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
If fairings come thus plentifully in:
A lady wall'd about witth diamonds!
Look you what I have from the loving king.

 Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.

 Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
But, Rosaline, you have a favor too:
Who sent it? and what is it?

 Any thing like?

 Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.

 But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?

 Did he not send you twain?

 I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short?

 We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.

 None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd.
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.

 Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
                 Enter BOYET.
 Thy news, Boyet?

 Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.

 But what, but what, come they to visit us?

 And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
For, ladies, we will every one be mask'd;
And not a man of them shall have the grace,
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
And then the king will court thee for his dear;
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
And change you favors too; so shall your loves
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.

 The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
They do it but in mocking merriment;
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet,
With visages display'd, to talk and greet.

 No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.

 Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
Trumpets sound within. 
 Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.

 Seventh sweet, adieu:
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.

 Let it not be sweet.

 Gall! bitter.

 Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
Exeunt King, Lords, and Blackamoors.
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?

 O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.

 Biron did swear himself out of all suit.

 Qualm, perhaps.

 Go, sickness as thou art!

 And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.

 Will they return?

 How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.

 Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
If they return in their own shapes to woo?

 Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.

Exeunt Princess, Rosaline, Katharine, and Maria.
Re-enter the King, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper habits. 
 'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.

 Then wish me better; I will give you leave.

 This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.

 You nickname virtue: vice you should have spoke;
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
As the unsullied lily, I protest,
A world of torments though I should endure,
I would not yield to be your house's guest;
So much I hate a breaking cause to be
Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.

 Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
A mess of Russians left us but of late.

 Ay, in truth, my lord;
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.

 Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?

 No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.

 The fairest is confession.
Were not you here but even now disguised?

 And were you well advised?

 When you then were here,
What did you whisper in your lady's ear?

 When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.

 Peace, peace! forbear:
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.

 I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?

 God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
Most honorably doth unhold his word.

 Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?

 Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
When great things laboring perish in their birth.

   Great thanks, great Pompey.

 The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed. good Alexander.

 Stand aside, good Pompey.
Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules. 
 Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
          Enter ARMADO, for Hector.
 Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.

  Dead, for my life!

  Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
For all your fair endeavours; and entreat,
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits,
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
In the converse of breath: your gentleness
Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord!
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.

 I understand you not: my griefs are double.

 We have received your letters full of love;
Your favors, the ambassadors of love;
And, in our maiden council, rated them
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
As bombast and as lining to the time:
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion, like a merriment.

 A time, methinks, too short
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
If for my love, as there is no such cause,
You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
But that it bear this trial and last love;
Then, at the expiration of the year,
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,
I will be thine; and till that instant shut
My woeful self up in a mourning house,
Raining the tears of lamentation
For the remembrance of my father's death.
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
Neither intitled in the other's heart.

 Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.

 Was not that Hector?

"
1078,ros.,ROSALINE,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-ros.," Another of these students at that time
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal:
His eye begets occasion for his wit;
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

 Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

 How needless was it then to ask the question!

 'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.

 Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

        No point, with my knife.

 And yours from long living!

 Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.

 Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.

 Ay, our way to be gone.

 Shall I teach you to know?

 Why, she that bears the bow.
Finely put off!

 Well, then, I am the shooter.

 If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
Finely put on, indeed!

  Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
Thou canst not hit it, my good man.

 Madame, came nothing else along with that?

 That was the way to make his godhead wax,
For he hath been five thousand years a boy,

 You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.

 What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?

 We need more light to find your meaning out.

 Look, what you do, you do it still i' the dark.

 Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.

 Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'

 I would you knew:
An if my face were but as fair as yours,
My favour were as great: be witness this.
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs,
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!

 Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.

 'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
My red dominical, my golden letter:
O that your face were not so full of O's!

 They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
O that I knew he were but in by the week!
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
And wait the season and observe the times
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
And shape his service wholly to my hests
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
That he should be my fool and I his fate.

 The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.

 Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.

 But shall we dance, if they desire us to 't?

 What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
If they do speak our language, 'tis our will
That some plain man recount their purposes:
Know what they would.

 What would they, say they?

 Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.

 It is not so. Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
The measure then of one is easily told.

 How many weary steps,
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
Are number'd in the travel of one mile?

 My face is but a moon, and clouded too.

 O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.

 Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
Music plays. 
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.

 You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.

 Our ears vouchsafe it.

 Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.

 Only to part friends:
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.

 We can afford no more at such a price.

 Your absence only.

 Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
Twice to your visor, and half once to you.

 In private, then.

 Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.

 Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.

 O, they were all in lamentable cases!
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.

 Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.

 Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
Let's mock them still, as well known as disguised:
Let us complain to them what fools were here,
Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
And wonder what they were and to what end
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
Should be presented at our tent to us.

 Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
My lady, to the manner of the days,
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord.
They did not bless us with one happy word.
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.

 This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--

 But that you take what doth to you belong,
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.

 All the fool mine?

 Which of the vizards was it that you wore?

 There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
That hid the worse and show'd the better face.

 Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.

 Sans sans, I pray you.

 It is not so; for how can this be true,
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?

 Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.

 Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
As precious eyesight, and did value me
Above this world; adding thereto moreover
That he would wed me, or else die my lover.

 By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.

 We did not quote them so.

 You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd,
You are attaint with faults and perjury:
Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
But seek the weary beds of people sick.]

 Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
And therewithal to win me, if you please,
Without the which I am not to be won,
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
With all the fierce endeavour of your wit
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.

 Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
Deaf'd with the clamors of their own dear groans,
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
And I will have you and that fault withal;
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
And I shall find you empty of that fault,
Right joyful of your reformation.

"
1079,mar.,MARIA,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-mar.," I know him, madam: at a marriagefeast,
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
Is a sharp wit match'd with too blunt a will;
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power.

 They say so most that most his humours know.

 That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
Not a word with him but a jest.

 Two hot sheeps, marry.

 You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?

 Not so, gentle beast:
My lips are no common, though several they be.

 To my fortunes and me.

 He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.

 No.

 You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes at the brow.

 A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.

 Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.

 Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.

 This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
The letter is too long by half a mile.

 Ay, or I would these hands might never part.

 Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.

 Name it.

 Say you so?  Fair lord,--
Take that for your fair lady.

 Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.

 Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.

 At the twelvemonth's end
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.

 The liker you; few taller are so young.

"
1080,kath.,KATHARINE,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-kath.," The young Dumain; a well-accomplished youth,
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.

 Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.

 He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
And so she died: had she been light, like you,
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.

 A light condition in a beauty dark.

 You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.

 So do not you, for you are a light wench.

 You weigh me not?   O, that's you care not for me.

 Fair as a text B in a copy-book.

 A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.

 Madam, this glove.

 Yes, madam, and moreover
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.

 But in this changing what is your intent?

 What, was your vizard made without a tongue?

 O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.

 Veal, quoth the Dutchman.   Is not 'veal' a calf?

 No, a fair lord calf.

 No, I'll not be your half:
Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.

 Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.

 Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
They converse apart. 
 Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
And trow you what he call'd me?

 Yes, in good faith.

 And Longaville was for my service born.

 A beard, fair health, and honesty;
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.

 Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
Come when the king doth to my lady come;
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.

 Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.

"
1081,jaq.,JAQUENETTA,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-jaq.,"       God give you good morrow, master Parson.

 God bless the king!

 I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.

 Of Costard.

"
1083,king.,CLAUDIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-king.," Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,— 
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,—
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, 
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,—
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose,—to suppress 
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

 We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius. 
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

 Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

 Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,—

 How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term             
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition 
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd; whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
>From the first corse till he that died to-day,

'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love           
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

 Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the king's rouse the heavens shall bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

Exeunt all but Hamlet.
 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,      
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time: so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

 Thou still hast been the father of good news.

 O, speak of that; that do I long to hear. 

 Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.   Exit Polonius. 
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
The head and source of all your son's distemper.

 Well, we shall sift him.
Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS.
Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?

 It likes us well;   
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labor:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
Most welcome home!
Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.
 But how hath she
Received his love?

 As of a man faithful and honorable.

 Do you think 'tis this?

 Not that I know.
 How may we try it further?

 We will try it.

 And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

 With all my heart; and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclined.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And drive his purpose on to these delights.

 Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here 
Affront Ophelia:
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
If't be the affliction of his love or no
That thus he suffers for.

 O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! 
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
O heavy burthen!

 Love! his affections do not that way tend; 
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
For the demand of our neglected tribute:
Haply the seas and country different
With variable objects shall expel           
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?

 It shall be so:
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
[Exeunt.      I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range.   Therefore prepare you;
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you:
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies.

 Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
Which now goes too free-footed.

 Thanks, dear my lord.
Exit Polonius.
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent; 
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow?   Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,       
Or pardon'd being down?   Then I'll look up;
My fault is past.   But, O, what form of prayer
Can serve my term?   'Forgive me my foul murder'?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above; 
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
O wretched state!  O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, strupgling to be free,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel, 
Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
All may be well.

Retires and kneels.
                Enter HAMLET.
 My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

[Exit. There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?

 What, Gertrude?   How does Hamlet?

 O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there:
His liberty is full of threats to all;
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
We would not understand what was most fit;
But, like the owner of a foul disease,     
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?

 O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed 
We must, with all our majesty and skill,
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
        Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.
Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
And what's untimely done........       
Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
As level as the cannon to his blank,
Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,
And hit the woundless air. O, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
[Exeunt. I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgement, but their eyes;
And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is  weigh'd,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,         
Or not at all.
             Enter ROSENCRANTZ.
How now! what hath befall'n?

 But where is he?

        Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,—
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
For that which thou hast done,—must send thee hence
With fiery quickness; therefore prepare thyself;
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The associates tend, and every thing is bent
For England.

                 Ay, Hamlet.

 So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes. 

 Thy loving father, Hamlet.

 Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught— 
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us—thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
By letters congruing to that effect,
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

[Exit.     Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
[Exit Horatio. 
O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
All from her father's death.  O Gertrude, Gertrude,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
But in battalions. First, her father slain:
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author 
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
Divided from herself and her fair judgement,
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear     
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
Gives me superfluous death.
[A noise within.

 Where are my Switzers?   Let them guard the door.

Enter another Gentleman.
What is the matter?

 The doors are broke.     [Noise within.
Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following.
 What is the cause, Laertes, 
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
That treason can but peep to what it would,
Acts little of his will. Tell us, Laertes,
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.

           Dead.

 Let him demand his fill.

 Who shall stay you?

 Good Laertes,
If you desire to know the certainty       
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
Winner and loser?

 Will you know them then?

 Why, now you speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
And am most sensibly in grief for it,       
It shall as level to your judgement pierce
As day does to your eye.

 Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Or you deny me right.   Go but apart,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
If by direct or by collateral hand
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
And we shall jointly labor with your soul
To give it due content.

 So you shall;
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
I pray you, go with me.
[Exeunt. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.

 O, for two special reasons;
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd, 
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself—
My virtue or my plague, be it either which—
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not but by her. The other motive,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, 
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
And not where I had aimed them.

 Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think 
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—
              Enter a Messenger.
How now! what news?

 From Hamlet! who brought them?
 Laertes, you shall hear them.
Leave us.
[Exit Messenger.
[Reads]
'High and mighty, You shall know
I am set naked on your kingdom. To-morrow
shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when
I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount
the occasion of my sudden and more
strange return.         'HAMLET.'

What should this mean?   Are all the rest come back? 
Or is it some abuse and no such thing?

 'Tis Hamlet's character.   'Naked!'
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
Can you advise me?

 If it be so, Laertes—
As how should it be so? how otherwise?—
Will you be ruled by me?

 To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
No more to undertake it, I will work him
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
And call it accident.

 It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
Of the unworthiest siege.

 A very riband in the cap of youth,
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
The light and careless livery that it wears 
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:—
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
As had he been incorpsed and demi-natured
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,      
Come short of what he did.

 A Norman.

 The very same.

 He made confession of you,
And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especial,
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation, 
He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
Now, out of this,—

 Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?

 Not that I think you did not love your father;
But that I know love is begun by time;
And that I see, in passages of proof,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
Dies in his own too much: that we would do,
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes 
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
That hurts by easing.   But, to the quick o' the ulcer:—
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
To show yourself your father's son in deed
More than in words?

 No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. 
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
Most generous and free from all contriving,
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice
Requite him for your father.

 Let's further think of this;
Weigh what convenience both of time and means 
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
Should have a back or second, that might hold,
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings:
I ha't:
When in your motion you are hot and dry—
And make your bouts more violent to that end—
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him 
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
Our purpose may hold there.
                 Enter QUEEN.How now, sweet queen!

 Let's follow, Gertrude:
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Now fear I this will give it start again;
Therefore let's follow.
[Exeunt. Pluck them asunder.

 O, he is mad, Laertes.

 I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
[Exit Horatio. 
[To Laertes]Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
We'll put the matter to the present push.
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument: 
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
        [Exeunt. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
[The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.
 Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, 
You know the wager?

 I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.

 Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange, 
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark's crown have worn.   Give me the cups;
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.'   Come, begin:
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.   

 Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Here's to thy health.
[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.Give him the cup.

 Our son shall win.

 Gertrude, do not drink.

 It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.

 I do not think't.
 Part them: they are incensed.

 She swounds to see them bleed.

 O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

"
1084,ham.,"HAMLET, son to the late",Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-ham.," A little more than kin, and less than kind.

 Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.

 Ay, madam, it is common.

 Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,   
Nor the dejected 'haviour of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

 I shall in all my best obey you, madam. 

 O, that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!        
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on 't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was, to this,      
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month—
Let me not think on't—Frailty, thy name is woman!—
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears:—why she, even she—
O God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn'd longer—married with my uncle, 
My father's brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO.
 I am glad to see you well: 
Horatio,—or I do forget myself.

 Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
Marcellus?

 I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

 I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, 
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

 I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

 Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats 
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father!—methinks I see my father.

 In my mind's eye, Horatio.

 He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.

 Saw? who?                        

 The king my father?

 For God's love, let me hear.

 But where was this?

 Did you not speak to it?

 'Tis very strange. 

 Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?

 Arm'd, say you?

 From top to toe?

 Then saw you not his face?

 What, look'd he frowningly?     

 Pale or red?

 And fix'd his eyes upon you?

 I would I had been there.

 Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

 His beard was grizzled,—no? 

 I will watch to-night;
Perchance 'twill walk again.

 If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue: 
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I'll visit you.

 Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
Exeunt all but Hamlet.
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

Exit.  The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

 What hour now?

 The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out 
The triumph of his pledge.

 Ay, marry, is't:
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honor'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes      
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth—wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin—
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, 
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,—
Their virtues else—be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo—
Shall in the general censure take corruption
>From that particular fault: the dram of eale

Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.

 Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
[Ghost beckons Hamlet. 
 It will not speak; then I will follow it.

 Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.

 It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.

 Hold off your hands. 

 My fate cries out,
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
I say, away!   Go on; I'll follow thee.
Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
 Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.

 I will.

 Alas, poor ghost!

 Speak; I am bound to hear.

 What?

 O God!

 Murder!

 Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,   
May sweep to my revenge.

 O my prophetic soul!   
My uncle!

 O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
And shall I couple hell?   O, fie!   Hold, hold, my heart;
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe.   Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there; 
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables,—meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
[Writing.
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'      
I have sworn't.

 So be it!

 Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.

 Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS. 
 O, wonderful!

 No; you'll reveal it.

 How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?

 There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.

 Why, right; you are i' the right;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
For every man has business and desire, 
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Look you, I'll go pray.

 I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, 'faith, heartily.

 Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
It is an honest ghost, that let tell you:
For your desire to know what is between us,
O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends, 
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
Give me one poor request.

 Never make known what you have seen to-night.

 Nay, but swear 't.

 Upon my sword.

 Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

 Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? 
Come on—you hear this fellow in the cellarage—
Consent to swear.

 Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Swear by my sword.

 Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Swear by my sword.

 Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioner!   Once more remove, good friends.

 And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
But come;
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, 
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, 
Swear.

 Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!   They swear.] So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you:
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
God willing, shall not lack.   Let us go in together;
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
That ever I was born to set it right!     
Nay, come, let's go together.
[Exeunt.             Good lads, how do ye both?

                                  ‘One fair daughter, and no more,
	      The which he loved passing well.’
	        ‘The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,’
	    ‘The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
	      Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
	      When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
	      Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
	      With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
	      Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
	      With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons, 
	      Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
	      That lend a tyrannous and damned light
	      To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
	      And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
	      With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
	      Old grandsire Priam seeks.’
	             Now I am alone.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force so his soul to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, 
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her?   What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have?   He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free, 
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears.
Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat, 
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Ha!
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal:  bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!                               
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon 't! foh!   About, my brain!   I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently 
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy, 
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
More relative than this: the play's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
[Exit. To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end   
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, 
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will   
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.—Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia!   Nymph, in thy orisons
—Be all my sins remembered.

 I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

 No, not I;
I never gave you aught.

               Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.       

 Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee?   Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, 
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Whose blood and judgement are so well commingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee.—Something too much of this.—
There is a play to-night before the king;   
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,       
And after we will both our judgements join
In censure of his seeming.

 They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
Get you a place.

Danish march. A flourish.
 Enter KING, QUEEN, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others.
                   Wormwood, wormwood.

 If she should break it now! 

          Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
	       The hart uncalled play;
	      For some must watch, while some must sleep: 
	       So runs the world away.
	     For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
	      This realm dismantled was
	      Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
	      A very, very—pajock.
	       For if the king like not the comedy,  
	      Why, then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
	                           'Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother. 
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
How in my words soever she be shent,
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
Exit. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
And now I'll do't.   And so he goes to heaven;
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
A villain kills my father; and for that,
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
To heaven.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of bread; 
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought.
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
No!
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; 
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
That has no relish of salvation in't;
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
As hell, whereto it goes.   My mother stays:
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

Exit.
 Mother, mother, mother!

 Now, mother, what's the matter?

 Mother, you have my father much offended. 

 Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

 What's the matter now?

 No, by the rood, not so:
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
And—would it were not so!—you are my mother.

 Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you. 

 How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!

[Makes a pass through the arras.
 Nay, I know not:
Is it the king?

 A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

 Ay, lady, 'twas my word. 
[Lifts up the arras and discovers Polonius.
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If damned custom have not brass'd it so
That it be proof and bulwark against sense.

 Such an act 
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
>From the fair forehead of an innocent love

And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom, 
Is thought-sick at the act.

 Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed,         
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother.   Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor?   Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement 
Would step from this to this?   Sense, sure, you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference.   What devil was't
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense      
Could not so mope.
O shame! where is thy blush?   Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will.

 Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty,—

 A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
And put it in his pocket!

 A king of shreds and patches,—
Enter Ghost.
Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards!   What would your gracious figure?

 Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command?
O, say!

 How is it with you, lady?

 On him, on him!   Look you, how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable.  Do not look upon me;
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects: then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood. 

 Do you see nothing there?

 Nor did you nothing hear?

 Why, look you there look, how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
Exit Ghost. 
 Ecstasy !
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, 
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
Would gambol from.   Mother, for love of grace,
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
To make them ranker.   Forgive me this my virtue;
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

 O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.       
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
And either....the devil, or throw him out
With wondrous potency.   Once more, good night: 
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
[Pointing to Polonius.
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
To punish me with this and this with me,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more, good lady.

 Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madness,
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, 
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
And break your own neck down.

 I must to England; you know that?

 There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
Hoist with his own petar: and't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
When in one line two crafts directly meet. 
This man shall set me packing:
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother.
Exeunt severally; Hamlet dragging in Polonius.   Compounded it with dust, whereto
'tis kin.

                   For England!

                          Good.

  My mother: father and mother is
man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; 
and so, my mother. Come, for England! 
      [Exit.
 Good sir, whose powers are these?

 How purposed, sir, I pray you?

 Who commands them, sir?

 Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or some frontier?

 Why, then the Polack never will defend it.

 Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw:
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.

 I'll be with you straight.   Go a little before.
[Exeunt all except Hamlet, 
How all occasions do inform against me,
And spur my dull revenge!   What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple 
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Makes mouths at the invisible event,        
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,   
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not tomb enough and continent
Fo hide the slain?   O, from this time forth,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
[Exit.                              Imperious Cæsar, dead and turn'd to clay,
	      Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
	      O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
	      Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
	    But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king,

Enter Priests, &c. in procession; the Corpse
   of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; 
   KING, QUEEN, their trains, &c.

The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow? 
And with such maimed rites?   This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
A very noble youth: mark.
[Retiring with Horatio.
 That is Laertes,
 What, the fair Ophelia!

 What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, 
Hamlet the Dane.
[Leaps into the grave.
 Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.

 Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.      

 I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?

 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Woo't weep?   woo't fight?   woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Make Ossa like a wart!   Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'll rant as well as thou.

 Hear you, sir;   
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
[Exit.
 So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
You do remember all the circumstance?

 Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,   
Rough-hew them how we will,—

 Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them; had my desire,
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again; making so bold,
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,—
O royal knavery!—an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons 
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
My head should be struck off.

 Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?

 Being   thus be-netted   round   with villanies,—
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, 
They had begun the play—I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair and labor'd much
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote?

 An earnest conjuration from the king,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As love between them like the palm might flourish, 
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
Ard many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents.
Without debatement further, more or less,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving-time allow'd.

 Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Which was the model of that Danish seal; 
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
Subscribed it, gave 't the impression, placed it safely,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Thou know'st already.

 Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.

 Does it not, think'st thee, stand me, now upon—
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage—is't not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil?                               

 It will be short: the interim is mine;
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
For, by the image of my cause, I see
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion.

                      I be so able as now. 

      Give me your pardon, sir: I 've done you wrong;
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd 
With sore distraction. What I have done,
That might your nature, honour and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes?   Never Hamlet:
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then?   His madness: if't be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.     
Sir, in this audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
And hurt my brother.

 I embrace it freely;
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.

 I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
Stick fiery off indeed.

 No, by this hand.

 Very well, my lord;
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.

 This likes me well.  These foils have all a length?       [They prepare to play. 
 Come on, sir.

 One.

 Judgement.

 I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
Come. They play.
Another hit; what say you?

 Good madam!

 I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.

 Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
I pray you, pass with our best violence;
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.   

 Nay, come, again.    [The Queen falls.
 How does the queen?

 O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
Treachery! Seek it out.

 The point envenom'd too!
Then, venom, to thy work.  [Stabs the King.
 Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Follow my mother.    [King dies.
 Heaven make thee free of it!   I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
Had I but time—as this fell sergeant, death,
Is strict in his arrest—O, I could tell you—
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied.

 As thou'rt a man,
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story.
[March afar off, and shot within.
What warlike noise is this?

 O, I die, Horatio;
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Which have solicited.   The rest is silence.    [Dies.
"
1085,pol.,POLONIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-pol.," He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laborsome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:   
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

 Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.   
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,       
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man. 
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

 The time invites you; go; your servants
tend.

 What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

 Marry, well bethought:              
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
What is between you? give me up the truth.

 Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

 Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Running it thus—you'll tender me a fool.

 Ah, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.

 Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.   I do know,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Even in their promise, as it is a-making, 
You must not take for fire. From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him, that he is young,
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds, 
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.

 Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

 You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Of his behavior.

 Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
And in part him:' do you mark this, Reynaldo ?

 'And in part him; but you may say 'not well:
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
As may dishonor him; take heed of that;
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.

 Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Drabbing: you may go so far.

 'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency;
That's not my meaning; but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.

 Wherefore should you do this?

 Marry, sir, here's my drift;
And, I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
Mark you,                                    
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence;
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country.

  At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions out:
So by my former lecture and advice,
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

 God be wi' you; fare you well.

 Observe his inclination in yourself.

 And let him ply his music.

 Farewell!
Exit Reynaldo.
                Enter OPHELIA.
 How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?

 With what, i' the name of God?

 Mad for thy love?

 What said he?

 Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?

 That hath made him mad. 
I am sorry that with better heed and judgement
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion.   Come, go we to the king:
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
Exeunt. The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, 
Are joyfully return'd.

 Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
And I do think, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath used to do, that I have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

 Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

 This business is well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, 
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.

 Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect, 
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause:
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
Perpend.
I have a daughter—have while she is mine—
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.




[Reads. 

‘To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
 beautified Ophelia,’ —
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' 
is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. 
Thus:      Reads.
'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.' Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.  [Reads. 
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
  Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
  But never doubt I love.            
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
    'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst
            this machine is to him, HAMLET. 

'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
  Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
  But never doubt I love.            
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
As they fell out by time, by means and place,
All given to mine ear.

 What do you think of me?

 I would fain prove so.   But what might you think, 
When I had seen this hot love on the wing—
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Before my daughter told me—what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
What might you think?   No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star; 
This must not be:' and then I prescripts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repulsed—a short tale to make—
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves, 
And all we mourn for.

 Hath there been such a time—I'd fain know that—
That I have positive said ''Tis so,'
When it proved otherwise?

 Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
If circumstances lead me, I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the centre.

 You know, sometimes he walks four hours together 
Here in the lobby.

 At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Mark the encounter: if he love her not
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
But keep a farm and carters.

 Away, I do beseech you, both away:
I'll board him presently.

Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.
            Enter HAMLET, reading.
O, give me leave:   
                            'Tis most true:
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter.

 Ophelia, walk you here.   Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves. [To Ophelia] Read on this book;
That show of such an exercise may color
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,—
'Tis too much proved—that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself.

 I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
Exeunt King and Polonius. 
                Enter HAMLET.
 It shall do well: but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
But, if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him 
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him, or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.

           My lord, he's going to his mother's closet: 
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:
And, as you said, and wisely was it said, 
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know.

 He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
Much heat and him.   I'll sconce me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.

 What, ho! help, help, help!
 O, I am slain!

1086,hor.,HORATIO,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-hor.," Friends to this ground.

 A piece of him.

 Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

 Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

 Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.

 What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!

 Stay! speak, speak!   I charge thee, speak!
Exit Ghost. 
 Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.

 As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on        
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.

 In what particular thought to work I know not:
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

 That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet—
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him—
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent      
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other—
As it doth well appear unto our state—    
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

 A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: 
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on.
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.—
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!

Re-enter Ghost.
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,   
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:

Cock crows.
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

 Do, if it will not stand.

 'Tis here!

 And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, 
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.

 So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, 
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

 Hail to your lordship!

 The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

 A truant disposition, good my lord.

 My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

 Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.

 Where, my lord?

 I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

 My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

 My lord, the king your father.

 Season your admiration for a while
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.

 Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernado, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter'd.   A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,          
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch:
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good, 
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.

 My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from our sight.

 As I do live, my honor'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.

 O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.

 A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

 Nay, very pale.

 Most constantly.

 It would have much amazed you.

 While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

 Not when I saw 't.

 It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.

 I warrant it will.

 It is a nipping and an eager air.

 I think it lacks of twelve.

 Indeed?   I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within.
What does this mean, my lord?

 Is it a custom?

 Look, my lord, it comes!

Enter Ghost.
 It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.

 No, by no means.

 Do not, my lord.

 What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff   
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? think of it:
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more motive, into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.

 Be ruled; you shall not go.

 He waxes desperate with imagination.

 Have after. To what issue will this come?

 Heaven will direct it.

 Heaven secure him!

 Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

 What news, my lord?

 Good my lord, tell it.

 Not I, my lord, by heaven.

 There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this.

 These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

 There's no offence, my lord.

 What is't, my lord? we will.

 In faith,
My lord, not I.

 Propose the oath, my lord.

 O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

  O, my dear lord,—

 Well, my lord:
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

     'Twere good she were spoken with: for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

 What are they that would speak with me?

 Let them come in.
[Exit Servant.
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
                 Enter Sailors.
            Good my lord, be quiet.
[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.
 Remember it, my lord!

 That is most certain.

 Is't possible?

 I beseech you.

 Ay, good my lord.

 How was this seal'd?

 So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

 Why, what a king is this!

 It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.

 Peace! who comes here? 
                  Enter OSRIC.
         They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

 Never believe it:     
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
Here's yet some liquor left.

 Now cracks a noble heart.   Good night, sweet prince; 
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?
[March within.
 Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,  and others.

 What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

 Not from his mouth,
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Are here arrived, give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view; 
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about: so shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgements, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall'n on the inventor's heads: all this can I
Truly deliver.

 Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance,
On plots and errors, happen.

"
1087,laer.,LAERTES,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-laer.," My dread lord, 
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

 My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.

 For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
No more.

 Think it no more:     
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal.   Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs, 
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, 
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

 O, fear me not. 
I stay too long: but here my father comes.

Enter POLONIUS.
A double blessing is a double grace;
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

 Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

 Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
What I have said to you.

 Farewell.  Exit.
 Where is this king?   Sirs, stand you all without.

 I pray you, give me leave.

 I thank you; keep the door.   O thou vile king,
Give me my father!

 That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
Of my true mother.

 Where is my father?

 How came he dead?   I'll not be juggled with: 
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
Most throughly for my father.

 My will, not all the world:
And for my means, I'll husband them   so well,
They shall go far with little.

 None but his enemies.

 To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
Repast them with my blood.

 How now! what noise is that?

               Re-enter OPHELIA.
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
Should be as moral as an old man's life? 
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.
 Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
It could not move thus.
   Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
She turns to favor and to prettiness.
  Let this be so;
His means of death, his obscure funeral—
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No noble rite nor formal ostentation—
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call't in question.

 It well appears: but tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
You mainly were stirr'd up.

 And so have I a noble father lost;
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.

 Know you the hand?

 I'm lost in it, my lord.   But let him come;
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
'Thus didest thou.'

 Ay, my lord;   
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

 My lord, I will be ruled;
The rather, if you could devise it so         
That I might be the organ.

 What part is that, my lord?

 A Norman was't?

 Upon my life, Lamond.

 I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation.

 What out of this, my lord?

 Why ask you this?   

 To cut his throat i' the church.

 I will do't:   
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
It may be death.

 Drown'd!   O, where?

 Alas, then, she is drown'd?

 Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
But that this folly douts it.
Exit.
 What ceremony else?

  Must there no more be done?

 Lay her i' the earth:
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring!   I tell thee, churlish priest,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
When thou liest howling.

 O, treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, 
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:       
Leaps into the grave.
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
To o'erton old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus.

 The devil take thy soul!
[Grappling with him.
 I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters, of known honor,
I have a voice and precedent of peace, 
To keep my name ungored.   But till that time,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
And will not wrong it.

 Come, one for me.

 You mock me, sir.

 This is too heavy, let me see another.

 Come, my lord.
They play.
 No.

 Well; again.

 A touch, a touch, I do confess.

 My lord, I'll hit him now.

 And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.

 Say you so? come on.
[They play.
 Have at you now!
[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling,
 they change rapiers, and Hamlet
 wounds Laertes.
 Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

 It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice
Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie, 
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.

 He is justly served;
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, 
Nor thine on me!       [Dies.

Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
But, better look'd into, he truly found
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
That so his sickness, age and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more   
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polack:

Through your dominions for this enterprise,
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down.

Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.

                       He does confess he feels himself distracted;
But from what cause he will by no means  speak.

 Most like a gentleman.

 Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Most free in his reply.

 Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it: they are about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order 
This night to play before him.

 We shall, my lord.
Exeunt Rosencranlz and Guildenstern.
       The single and peculiar life is bound,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls, 
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.

 What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?

 Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel. 

     Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
We cannot get from him.

 Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

  Will't please you go, my lord? 

"
1091,guil.,GUILDENSTERN,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-guil.," But we both obey,
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To be commanded.

 Heavens make our presence and our practices
Pleasant and helpful to him!

  Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.

         Nor do we find him forward to be  sounded,
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.

 But with much forcing of his disposition.

              We will ourselves provide:
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty.

 Look to the queen there, ho!

 How is't, Laertes?

 Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, 
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley.

"
1093,gent.,A Gentleman,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-gent.," She is importunate, indeed distract:
Her mood will needs be pitied.

 She speaks much of her father; says she hears
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; 
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

 Save yourself, my lord:
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, 
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
And, as the world were now but to begin,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
They cry, 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'

As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
And, but that great command o'ersways the order, 
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her:
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Of bell and burial.

 No more be done:
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her     
As to peace-parted souls.

 O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?

 Holla! Bernardo!

 What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

 Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

 Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again! 

 Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

 Question it, Horatio.

 It is offended.

 'Tis gone, and will not answer.

 Is it not like the king?

 Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

 Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, 
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?

 Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

 'Tis gone!

Exit Ghost.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.

 It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long: 
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

 Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Exeunt. My good lord—

 My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

 No, it is struck.

 Look, with what courteous action 
It waves you to a more removed ground:
But do not go with it.

 You shall not go, my lord.

 Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

 Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. 

 Nay, let's follow him.
Exeunt. Lord Hamlet,—

 How is't, my noble lord?

 Nor I, my lord.   

 Nor I, my lord, in faith.

 We have sworn, my lord, already.

 He.

 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

 Have you had quiet guard?

 Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

 Say,
What, is Horatio there?

 Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus. 

 I have seen nothing.

 Sit down awhile; 
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.

 Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,—

Enter Ghost.
 In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

 Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.

 It would be spoke to.

 See, it stalks away!   

 How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?

 I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king 
That was and is the question of these wars.

 'Tis here!

 It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.

And let him know so.

 Go softly on.
[Exeunt Fortinbras and Soldiers,
Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others.
 Where is this sight?

 This quarry cries on havoc.   O proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck?

 Let us haste to hear it,
And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me. 

 Let four captains
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war 
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

 Against some part of Poland.

 The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.

 Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

 Yes, it is already garrison'd.

Where should we have our thanks?

"
1105,queen.,GERTRUDE,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-queen.," Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids         
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.

 If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?

 Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us: go not to Wittenberg.

 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile,
For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.

 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

 Ay, amen!

Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants.
                Enter POLONIUS.
 I doubt it is no other but the main;
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.

 More matter, with less art.

 Came this from Hamlet to her?

 It may be, very likely.

 So he does indeed.

 But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

 Did he receive you well?   

 Did you assay him
To any pastime?

 I shall obey you.
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues 
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.

    I'll warrant you,
Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.

[Polonius hides behind the arras
Enter HAMLET.
 Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

 Why, how now, Hamlet!

 Have you forgot me?

 Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

 What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
 O me, what hast thou done?

 O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

 As kill a king!

 What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?

 Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

 O Hamlet, speak no more:
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.

 O, speak to me no more;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet!

 No more!

 Alas, he's mad!

 Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, 
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Start up, and stand an end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience.   Whereon do you look?

 To whom do you speak this?

 Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

 No, nothing but ourselves.

 This is the very coinage of your brain:
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.

 O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

 What shall I do?   

 Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me.

 Alack, 
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

 Bestow this place on us a little while.
Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!

 Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
'Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!' 
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
The unseen good old man.

 To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

 I will not speak with her.

 What would she have?

 Let her come in.
[Exit Horatio.
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
It spills itself in fearing to be split.
Re-enter HORATIO with OPHELIA.
 How now, Ophelia! Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

   Alack, what noise is this?

 How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs! 

 Calmly, good Laertes.

                  But not by him,

 One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
So fast they follow: your sister's drowned, Laertes.

 There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples 
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke:
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or like a creature native and indued        
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.

 Drown'd, drown'd.

 Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
        [Scattering flowers.
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
And not have strew'd thy grave.

                  Hamlet, Hamlet!

 O my son, what theme?

 For love of God, forbear him.

 This is mere madness:
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
His silence will sit drooping.

 He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

 I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

 Come, let me wipe thy face.

 No, no, the drink, the drink,— O my dear Hamlet,— 
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.    [Dies.
"
1106,oph.,OPHELIA,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-oph.," Do you doubt that?

 No more but so?

 I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.

 'Tis in my memory locked,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

 So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

 He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me.                       

 I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

 My lord, he hath importuned me with love 
In honorable fashion.

 And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

 I shall obey, my lord.
Exeunt. O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!

 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle; 
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors,—he comes before me.

 My lord, I do not know;
But truly, I do fear it.

 He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
He falls to such perusal of my face       
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
And, to the last, bended their light on me.

 No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
I did repel his letters and denied
His access to me.

 Madam, I wish it may.  [Exit Queen.
 Good my lord, 
How does your honor for this many a day?

 My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.

 My honor'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind 
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.

         O, what a noble mind is here o'er- thrown!
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,   
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
         Re-enter KING and POLONIUS.
                 Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

 How should I your true love know 
	      From another one?
	      By his cockle hat and staff,
	      And his sandal shoon.
	     He is dead and gone, lady,
	       He is dead and gone;          
	      At his head a grass-green turf,
	       At his heels a stone.
	     White his shroud as the mountain snow,—
	     Larded with sweet flowers;
	       Which bewept to the grave did go
	      With true-love showers.
	      To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
	       All in the morning betime,
	      And I a maid at your window, 
	       To be your Valentine.
	      Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes, 
	      And dupp'd the chamber door;
	      Let in the maid, that out a maid
	      Never departed more.
	     By Gis and by Saint Charity,
	      Alack, and fie for shame!        
	      Young men will do't, if they come to't;    
	      By cock, they are to blame.
	      Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
	      You promised me to wed.
	      So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
	      An thou hadst not come to my bed. 
	      They bore him barefaced on the bier;
	      Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
	      And in his grave rain'd many a tear:—
	    Fare you well, my dove!

 You must sing a-down a-down,
	       An you call him a-down-a.
	      For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
		 And will he not come again?
		And will he not come again?
		No, no, he is dead:
		Go to thy death-bed:
		He never will come again.
	      His beard was as white as snow,
		All flaxen was his poll:
		He is gone, he is gone,
		And we cast away moan:
		God ha' mercy on his soul!
	      And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.

Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands hands
Unite communtual in most sacred bands.

 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou—

 I do believe you think what now you speak;
But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity:
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree; 
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change; 
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies,
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,      
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

 'Tis deeply sworn.   Sweet, leave me here awhile;  
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep.  [Sleeps.

1114,p.-queen.,Player Queen,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-p.-queen.," So many journeys may the sun and moon  
Make again count o'er ere love be done!
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
In either aught, or in extremity.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
And as my love is sized, my fear is so: 
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

            O, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
In second husband let me be accurst! 
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

 The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
A second time I kill my husband dead,
When second husband kisses me in bed.

 Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!  
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

            Sleep rock thy brain;
And never come mischance between us twain!

 My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.

 Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.

 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

 I am thy father's spirit,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine: 
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love—

 Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

 Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.

 I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused; but know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.

 Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,—
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline 
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
And prey on garbage.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom always of the afternoon,   
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; 
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unaneled,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head:
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!   
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her.   Fare thee well at once!
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:      
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
Exit.
 Swear.

 Swear.

 Swear.

 Swear.

 Do not forget: this visitation   
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Speak to her, Hamlet.
