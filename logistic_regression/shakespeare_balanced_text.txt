not love where he beloved read over julia heart thy first best love for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith into a thousand oaths and all those oaths descended into perjury to love me thou hast no faith left now unless two and that far worse than none better have none than plural faith which is too much by one thou counterfeit to thy true friend all men but proteus o heaven ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully please you repeat their names i show my mind according to my shallow simple skill as of a knight neat and fine but were i you he never should be mine well of his wealth but of himself so so lord lord to see what folly reigns in us pardon dear madam is a passing shame that i unworthy body as i am should censure thus on lovely gentlemen then thus of many good i think him

of all o they love least that let men know their love peruse this paper madam that the contents will show sir valentine page and sent i think from proteus he would have given it you but i being in the way did in your name receive it pardon the fault i pray to plead for love deserves more fee than hate that you may ruminate exit what would your ladyship i would it were that you might kill your stomach on your meat and not upon your maid nothing to take a paper up that i let fall nothing concerning me madam it will not lie where it concerns unless it have a false interpreter that i might sing it madam to a tune give me a note your ladyship can set it is too heavy for so light a tune ay and melodious were it would you sing it i can not reach so high keep tune there still so you will sing it out and yet methinks i do not like this tune no madam it is too sharp nay now you are too flat and mar the concord with too harsh a descant there wanteth but a mean to fill your song indeed i bid the base for proteus she makes it strange but she would be best pleased to be so anger with another letter exit madam dinner is ready and your father stays what shall these papers lie like here nay i was taken up for laying them down yet here they shall not lie for catching cold ay madam you may say what sights you see i see things too although you judge i wink alas the way is wearisome and long better forbear till proteus make return i do not seek to quench your love hot fire but qualify the fire extreme rage lest it should burn above the bounds of reason but in what habit will you go along why then your ladyship must cut your hair what fashion madam shall i make your breeches you must needs have them with a codpiece madam a round hose madam now not worth a pin unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on if you think so then stay at home and go not then never dream on infamy but go if proteus like your journey when you come no matter who displeased when you are gone i fear me he will scarce be pleased withal all these are servants to deceitful men pray heaven he prove so when you come to him in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maiden eyes besides the lottery of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing but if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit to yield myself his wife who wins me by that means i told you yourself renowned prince then stood as fair as any comer i have look on yet for my affection you must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage therefore be advised first forward to the temple after dinner your hazard shall be made go draw aside the curtains and discover the several caskets to this noble prince now make your choice the one of them contains my picture prince if you choose that then i am yours withal there take it prince and if my form lie there then i am yours he unlocks the golden casket a gentle riddance draw the curtains go let all of his complexion choose me so exeunt behold there stand the caskets noble prince if you choose that wherein i am contain straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized but if you fail without more speech my lord you must be gone from hence immediately to these injunctions every one doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self too long a pause for that which you find there to offend and judge are distinct offices and of opposed natures thus hath the candle singed the moth o these deliberate fools when they do choose they have the wisdom by their wit to lose come draw the curtain nerissa enter a servant here what would my lord no more i pray thee i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee thou such wit in praising him come come nerissa for i long to see quick cupid post that comes so mannerly i pray you tarry pause a day or two before you hazard for in choosing wrong i lose your company therefore forbear a while there something tells me but it is not love i would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality but lest you should not understand me well and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me i could teach you how to choose right but i am then forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do you make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes they have me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours o these naughty times put bars between the owners and their rights and so though yours not yours prove it so let fortune go to hell for it not i speak too long but is to peize the time to eke it and to draw it out in length to stay you from election upon the rack bassanio then confess what treason there is mingled with your love ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforced do speak anything well then confess and live away then i am lock in one of them if you do love me you will find me out nerissa and the rest stand all aloof let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and watery for him he may win and what is music then then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegroom ear and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with bleared visages come forth to view the issue of the exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that makest the fray music whilst bassanio comments on the caskets to himself song tell me where is fancy bred or in the heart or in the head how begot how nourished reply reply it is engender in the eyes with gazing fed and fancy dies in the cradle where it lies let us all ring fancy knell i begin it ding dong bell aside how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and despair and shuddering fear and jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rein thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtue beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlesson girl unschool unpractised happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you is this true nerissa so do i my lord they are entirely welcome there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper that steals the color from bassanio cheek some dear friend dead else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man what worse and worse with leave bassanio i am half yourself and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble what sum owes he the jew what no more pay him six thousand and deface the bond double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanio fault first go with me to church and call me wife and then away to venice to your friend for never shall you lie by portia side with an unquiet soul you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over when it is paid bring your true friend along my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows come away for you shall hence upon your bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer since you are dear bought i will love you dear but let me hear the letter of your friend o love dispatch all business and be gone i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish misery this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lord return there is a monastery two miles off and there will we abide i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself and so farewell till we shall meet again i thank you for your wish and am well pleased to wish it back on you fare you well jessica exeunt jessica and lorenzo now balthasar as i have ever found thee so let me find thee still take this same letter and use thou all the endeavour of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousin hand doctor bellario and look what notes and garments he doth give thee bring them i pray thee with imagined speed unto the tranect to the common ferry which trades to venice waste no time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of we see our husbands before they think of us they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack i hold thee any wager when we are both accoutred like young men i prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honorable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died i could not do withal then i repent and wish for all that that i had not kill them and twenty of these puny lies i tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practise fie what a question that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter but come i tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach which stays for us at the park gate and therefore haste away for we must measure twenty miles exeunt i did my lord i am informed throughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew is your name shylock of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law can not impugn you as you do proceed you stand within his danger do you not do you confess the bond then must the jew be merciful the quality of mercy is not strain it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence the merchant there is he not able to discharge the money it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it can not be i pray you let me look upon the bond shylock there thrice thy money offer thee why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchant heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond therefore lay bare your bosom it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death it is not so express but what of that good you do so much for charity you merchant have you any thing to say your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer a pound of that same merchant flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it tarry a little there is something else this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice unto the state of venice thyself shalt see the act for as thou urgest justice be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest soft the jew shall have all justice soft no haste he shall have nothing but the penalty therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou more or less than a just pound be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture he hath refused it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril jew tarry jew the law hath yet another hold on you it is enacted in the laws of venice if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen the party the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state and the offender life lies in the mercy of the duke only all other voice in which predicament i say thou for it appears by manifest proceeding that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant and thou hast the danger formerly by me rehearsed down therefore and beg mercy of the duke ay for the state not for antonio what mercy can you render him antonio art thou contented jew what dost thou say clerk draw a deed of gift i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua and it is meet i presently set forth he is well paid that is well satisfied and i delivering you am satisfied and therein do account myself well paid my mind was never yet more mercenary i pray you know me when we meet again i wish you well and so i take my leave you press me far and therefore i will yield to ant give me your gloves i wear them for your sake to bass and for your love i take this ring from you do not draw back your hand i take no more and you in love shall not deny me this i will have nothing else but only this and now methinks i have a mind to it i see sir you are liberal in offers you taught me first to beg and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answer that serves many men to save their gifts an if your wife be not a and know how well i have deserved the ring she would not hold out enemy for ever for giving it to me well peace be with you exeunt portia and nerissa inquire the jew house out give him this deed and let him sign it we away and be a day before our husbands home this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo enter gratiano that can not be his ring i do accept most thankfully and so i pray you tell him furthermore i pray you show my youth old shylock house aside to ner thou mayst i warrant we shall have old swearing that they did give the rings away to men but we outface them and outswear them too aloud away make haste thou where i will tarry that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season season are to their right praise and true perfection peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked music ceases he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice we have been praying for our husbands healths which speed we hope the better for our words are they return go in nerissa give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence nor you lorenzo jessica nor you a tucket sounds this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler is a day such as the day is when the sun is hid enter bassanio antonio gratiano and their followers let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all you are welcome home my lord you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy a quarrel ho already what the matter you were to blame i must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wife first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part

coriolanus crowned with an oaken garland with captains and soldiers and a herald nay my good soldier up my gentle marcius worthy caius and by honour newly named what is it must i call thee but o thy wife i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only there one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not show them how ye were disposed ere they lack power to cross you pray be counsell i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honour and policy like unsever friends i the war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by the other lose that they combine not there if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but roted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom truth now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretch be with thy knee bussing the in such business action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being

ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace blister be thy tongue for such a wish he was not born to shame upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit for is a throne where honour may be sole monarch of the universal earth o what a beast was i to chide at him shall i speak ill of him that is my husband ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name when i thy wife have mangled it but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin that villain cousin would have kill my husband back foolish tears back to your native spring your tributary drops belong to woe which you mistaking offer up to joy my husband lives that tybalt would have slain and tybalt dead that would have slain my husband all this is comfort wherefore weep i then some word there was worser than tybalt death that murder me i would forget it fain but o it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds is dead and romeo banished that that one word hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalt death was woe enough if it had ended there or if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be rank with other griefs why follow not when she said dead thy father or thy mother nay or both which modern lamentation might have moved but with a rearward following tybalt death is banished to speak that word is father mother tybalt romeo juliet all slain all dead is there is no end no limit measure bound in that word death no words can that woe sound where is my father and my mother nurse wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent when theirs are

the heart of all their loyalties wherein although my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putter on of these exactions yet the king our master whose honour heaven shield from soil he escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sides of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion no my lord you know no more than others but you frame things that are known alike which are not wholesome to those which would not know them and yet must perforce be their acquaintance these exactions whereof my sovereign would have note they are most pestilent to the hearing and to bear em the back is sacrifice to the load they say they are devised by you or else you suffer too hard an exclamation i am much too venturous in tempting of your patience but am under your promised pardon the subjects grief comes through commissions which compel from each the sixth part of his substance to be levied without delay and the pretence for this is named your wars in france this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them their curses now live where their prayers did and it come to pass this tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will i would your highness would give it quick consideration for there is no primer business i am sorry that the duke of buckingham is run in your displeasure my learn lord cardinal

nobler soul i say take heed yes heartily beseech you god mend all sir i desire you do me right and justice and to bestow your pity on me for i am a most poor woman and a stranger born out of your dominions having here no judge indifferent nor no more assurance of equal friendship and proceeding alas sir in what have i offended you what cause hath my behaviour given to your displeasure that thus you should proceed to put me off and take your good grace from me heaven witness i have been to you a true and humble wife at all times to your will conformable ever in fear to kindle your dislike yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry as i saw it inclined when was the hour i ever contradicted your desire or made it not mine too or which of your friends have i not strove to love although i knew he were mine enemy what friend of mine that had to him derived your anger did i continue in my liking nay gave notice he was from thence discharged sir call to mind that i have been your wife in this obedience upward of twenty years and have been blest with many children by you if in the course and process of this time you can report and prove it too against mine honour aught my bond to wedlock or my love and duty against your sacred person in god name turn me away and let the contempt shut door upon me and so give me up to the kind of justice please you sir the king your father was reputed for a prince most prudent of an excellent and unmatch wit and judgement ferdinand my father king of spain was reckon one the wisest prince that there had reign by many a year before it is not to be that they had gather a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deem our marriage lawful wherefore i humbly beseech you sir to spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel i will implore if not i the name of god your pleasure be fulfill lord cardinal to you i speak sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or long

sign your place and calling in full seeming with meekness and humility but your heart is cramm with arrogancy spleen and pride you have by fortune and his highness favours gone slightly low steps and now are mounted where powers are your retainers and your words domestics to you serve your will please yourself pronounce their office i must tell you you tender more your person honour than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge and here before you all appeal unto the pope to bring my whole cause his holiness and to be judged by him she curtsies to the king and offers to depart what need you note it pray you keep your way when you are call return now the lord help they vex me past my patience pray you pass on i will not tarry no nor ever more upon this

absolved in english to betray my lords i thank you both for your good wills ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so but how to make ye suddenly an answer in such a point of weight so near mine honour more near my lfe i fear with my weak wit and to such men of gravity and learning in truth i know not i was set at work among my maids full little god knows looking either for such men or such business for her sake that i have been for i feel the last fit of my greatness good your graces let me have time and counsel for my cause alas i am a woman friendless hopeless in england but little

him next heaven obey him been out of fondness superstitious to him almost forgot my prayers to content him and am i thus rewarded is not well lords bring me a constant woman to her husband one that dream a joy beyond his pleasure and to that woman when she has done most yet will i add an honour a great patience my lord i dare not make myself so guilty to give up willingly that noble title your master wed me to nothing but death shall divorce my dignities would i had never trod this english earth or felt the flatteries that grow upon it ye have angels faces but heaven knows your hearts what will become of me now wretched lady i am the most unhappy woman living alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes shipwreck upon a kingdom where no pity no friends no hope no kindred weep for me

the earth willing to leave their burthen reach a chair so now methinks i feel a little ease didst thou not tell me griffith as thou me that the great child of honour cardinal wolsey was dead prithee good griffith tell me how he died if well he stepp before me happily for my example alas poor man so may he rest his faults lie gently on him yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him and yet with charity he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion tied all the kingdom simony was his own opinion was his law i the presence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he is now nothing of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy ill example yes good griffith i were malicious else after my death i wish no other herald no other speaker of my living actions to keep mine honour from corruption but such an honest chronicler as griffith whom i most hated living thou hast made me with thy religious truth and modesty now in his ashes honour peace be with him patience be near me still and set me lower i have not long to trouble thee good griffith cause the musicians play me that sad note i named my knell whilst i sit meditating on that celestial harmony i go to sad and solemn music spirits of peace where are ye are ye all gone and leave me here in wretchedness behind ye it is not you i call for saw ye none enter since i slept no saw you not even now a blessed troop invite me to a banquet whose bright faces cast thousand beams upon me like the sun they promised me eternal happiness and brought me garlands griffith which i feel i am not worthy yet to wear i shall assuredly bid the music

comforts here but prayers how does his highness so may he ever do and ever flourish when i shall dwell with worms and my poor name banish the kingdom patience is that letter i caused you write yet sent away sir i most humbly pray you to deliver this to my lord the king in which i have commended to his goodness the model of our chaste loves his young daughter the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding she is young and of a noble modest nature i hope she will deserve well and a little to love her for her mother sake that loved him heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition is that his noble grace would have some pity upon my wretched women that so long have follow both my fortunes faithfully of which there is not one i dare avow and now i should not lie but will deserve for virtue and true beauty of the soul for honesty and decent carriage a right good husband let him be a noble and sure those men are happy that shall have the last is for my men they are the poorest but poverty could never draw from me that they may have their wages duly paid and something over to remember me by if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life and able means we had not parted thus these are the whole contents and good my lord by that you love the dearest in this world as you wish christian peace to souls departed stand these

to leave a more bitter than sweet at first to acquire after this process to give her the avaunt it is a pity would move a monster o god will much better she had known pomp be temporal yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce it from the bearer is a sufferance panging as soul and body severing so much the more must pity drop upon her verily i swear is better to be lowly born and range with humble livers in content than to be perk up in a glistering grief and wear a golden sorrow by my troth and maidenhead i would not be a queen nay good troth no not for all the riches under heaven no in truth

well a privilege never to see me more and from thy hated presence part i so see me no more whether he be dead or no exit dark night that from the eye his function takes the ear more quick of apprehension makes wherein it doth impair the seeing sense it pays the hearing double recompense thou art not by mine eye lysander found mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so what love could press lysander from my side you speak not as you think it can not be i am amazed at your passionate words i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me i understand not what you mean by this sweet do not scorn her so lysander whereto tends all this why are you grown so rude what change is this sweet love do you not jest what can you do me greater harm than hate hate me wherefore o me what news my love am not i hermia are not you lysander i am as fair now as i was erewhile since night you loved me yet since night you left me why then you left me o the gods forbid in earnest shall i say o me you juggler you cankerblossom you thief of love what have you come by night and stolen my love heart from him puppet why so ay that way goes the game now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures she hath urged her height and with her personage her tall personage her height forsooth she hath prevail with him and are you grown so high in his esteem because i am so dwarfish and so low how low am i thou painted maypole speak how low am i i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes lower hark again why get you gone who that hinders you what with lysander again nothing but and why will you suffer her to flout me thus let me come to her you mistress all this coil is of you nay go not back i am amazed and know not what to say exit never so weary never so in woe bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers i can no further crawl no further go my legs can keep no pace with my desires here will i rest me till the break of day heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray lies down and sleeps methinks i see these things with parted eye when every thing seems double yea and my father call you me fair that fair again unsay demetrius loves your fair o happy fair your eyes are and your tongue sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherd ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear sickness is catching o were favor so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongue sweet melody were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest i give to be to you translated o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius heart o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill o that my prayers could such affection move the more i love the more he hateth me none but your beauty would that fault were mine how happy some other some can be through athens i am thought as fair as she but what of that demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs doting on hermia eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vile holding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wing cupid painted blind nor hath love mind of any judgement taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguiled as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjured every where for ere demetrius look on hermia eyne he hail down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt i will go tell him of fair hermia flight then to the wood will he night pursue her and for this intelligence if i have thanks it is a dear expense but herein mean i to enrich my pain to have his sight thither and back again exit you draw me you adamant but yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel leave you your power to draw and i shall have no power to follow you and even for that do i love you the more i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you what worser place can i beg in your love and yet a place of high respect with me than to be used as you use your dog and i am sick when i look not on you your virtue is my privilege for that it is not night when i do see your face therefore i think i am not in the night nor doth this wood lack worlds of company for you in my respect are all the world then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me the wildest hath not such a heart as you run when you will the story shall be changed apollo flies and daphne holds the chase the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed when cowardice pursues and valor flies ay in the temple in the town the field you do me mischief fie demetrius your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex we can not fight for love as men may do we should be woo and were not made to woo exit dem i follow thee and make a heaven of hell to die upon the hand i love so well exit stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius o wilt thou darkling leave me do not so o i am out of breath in this fond chase the more my prayer the lesser is my grace happy is hermia she lies for she hath blesssed and attractive eyes how came her eyes so bright not with salt tears if so my eyes are oftener wash than hers no no i am as ugly as a bear for beasts that meet me run away for fear therefore no marvel though demetrius do as a monster fly my presence thus what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermia sphery eyne but who is here lysander on the ground dead or asleep i see no blood no wound lysander if you live good sir awake do not say so lysander say not so what though he love your hermia lord what though yet hermia still loves you then be content wherefore was i to this keen mockery born when at your hands did i deserve this scorn not enough not enough young man that i did never no nor never can deserve a sweet look from demetrius eye but you must flout my insufficiency good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do in such disdainful manner me to woo but fare you well perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness o that a lady of one man refused should of another therefore be abused exit you do advance your cunning more and more when truth kills truth o devilish holy fray these vows are hermia will you give her weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh your vows to her and me put in two scales will even weigh and both as light as tales nor none in my mind now you give her o spite o hell i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment if you were civil and knew courtesy you would not do me thus much injury can you not hate me as i know you do but you must join in souls to mock me too if you were men as men you are in show you would not use a gentle lady so to vow and swear and superpraise my parts when i am sure you hate me with your hearts you both are rivals and love hermia and now both rivals to mock helena a trim exploit a manly enterprise to conjure tears up in a poor maid eyes with your derision

i will be hang if some eternal villain some busy and insinuating rogue some cogging cozening slave to get some office have not devised this slander i be hang else a halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones why should he call her whore who keeps her company what place what time what form what likelihood the moor abused by some most villanous knave some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow o heaven that such companions unfold and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascals naked through the world even from the east to the west o fie upon them some such squire he was that turn your

well i the dark the world a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for but i do think it is their husbands faults if wives do fall say that they slack their duties and pour our treasures into foreign laps or else break out in peevish jealousies throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us or scant our former having in despite why we have galls and though we have some grace yet have we some revenge let husbands know their wives have sense like them they see and smell and have their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it that they do when they change us for others is it sport i think it is and doth affection breed it i think it doth is frailty that thus errs it is so too and have not we affections desires for sport and frailty as men have then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so what the matter what the matter husband alas good

i speak true so speaking as i think i die i die dies be quiet people wherefore throng you hither how long hath this possession held the man hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea buried some dear friend hath not else his eye stray his affection in unlawful love a sin prevailing much in youthful men who give their eyes the liberty of gazing which of these sorrows is he subject to you should for that have reprehended him ay but not rough enough haply in private ay but not enough and thereof came it that the man was mad the venom clamors of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog tooth it seems his sleeps were hinder by thy railing and thereof comes it that his head is light thou his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings unquiet meals make ill digestions thereof the raging fire of fever bred and what a fever but a fit of madness thou his sports were hinder by thy brawls sweet recreation barr what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy kinsman to grim and comfortless despair and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life in food in sport and rest to be disturb would mad or man or beast the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits no not a creature enters in my house neither he took this place for sanctuary and it shall privilege him from your hands till i have brought him to his wits again or lose my labor in assaying it be patient for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have with wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers to make of him a formal man again it is a branch and parcel of mine oath a charitable duty of my order therefore depart and leave him here with me be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him exit most mighty duke behold a man much wrong all gather to see them whoever bound him i will loose his bonds and gain a husband by his liberty speak old ægeon if thou the man that hadst a wife once call æmilia that bore thee at a burden two fair sons o if thou the same ægeon speak and speak unto the same æmilia by men of epidamnum he and i and the twin dromio all were taken up but by and by rude fishermen of corinth by force took dromio and my son from them and me they left with those of epidamnum what then became of them i can not tell i to this fortune that you see me in renowned duke vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us into the abbey here and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes and all that are assembled in this place that by this sympathized one day error have suffer wrong go keep us company and we shall make full satisfaction years have i but gone in travail of you my sons and till this present hour my heavy burthen delivered the duke my husband and my children both and you the calendars of their nativity go to a gossips feast and go with me after so long grief such festivity neither my husband nor the slave return that in such haste i sent to seek his master sure luciana it is two why should their liberty than ours be more look when i serve him so he takes it ill there none but asses will be bridled so this servitude makes you to keep unwed but were you wedded you would bear some sway how if your husband start some other where patience unmoved no marvel though she pause they can be meek that have no other cause a wretched soul bruised with adversity we bid be quiet when we hear it cry but were we burden with like weight of pain as much or more we should ourselves complain so thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me but if thou live to see like right bereft this patience in thee will be left say is your tardy master now at hand say didst thou speak with him thou his mind thou villain go back again thou slave and fetch him home back slave or i will break thy pate across hence prating peasant fetch thy master home his company must do his minions grace whilst i at home starve for a merry look hath homely age the alluring beauty took from my poor cheek then he hath wasted it are my discourses dull barren my wit if voluble and sharp discourse be marr unkindness blunts it more than marble hard do their gay vestments his affections bait that not my fault he master of my state what ruins are in me that can be found by him not ruin then is he the ground of my defeatures my decayed fair a sunny look of his would soon repair but too unruly deer he breaks the pale and feeds from home poor i am but his stale unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense i know his eye doth homage otherwhere or else what lets it but he would be here sister you know he promised me a chain would that alone alone he would detain so he would keep fair quarter with his bed i see the jewel best enamelled will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still that others touch and often touching will wear gold and no man that hath a name by falsehood and corruption doth it shame since that my beauty can not please his eye i weep what left away and weeping die ay ay antipholus look strange and frown some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects i am not adriana nor thy wife the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear that never object pleasing in thine eye that never touch well welcome to thy hand that never meat in thy taste unless i spake or look or touch or carved to

green and idle for girls of nine o think what they have done and then run mad indeed stark mad for all thy fooleries were but spices of it that thou polixenes was nothing that did but show thee of a fool inconstant and damnable ingrateful nor much thou wouldst have poison good camillo honor to have him kill a king poor trespasses more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon the casting forth to crows thy to be or none or little though a devil would have shed water out of fire ere nor directly laid to thee the death of the young prince whose honorable thoughts thoughts high for one so tender

and vengeance not dropp down yet i say she dead i if word nor oath prevail not go and see if you can bring tincture or lustre in her lip her eye heat outwardly or breath within i serve you as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant do not repent these things for they are heavier than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee to nothing but despair a thousand knees ten thousand years together naked fasting upon a barren mountain and still winter in storm perpetual could not move the gods to look that way thou wert i am sorry all faults i make when i shall come to know them i do repent alas i

for has not the divine apollo said not the tenor of his oracle that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found which that it shall is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me who on my life did perish with the infant is your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary oppose against their wills to leontes care not for issue the crown will find an heir great alexander left his to the worthiest so his successor was like to be the best and left them more rich for what they yielded had she such power she had just cause i should so were i the ghost that walk bid you mark her eye and tell me for what dull part you chose her then shriek that even your ears should rift to hear me and the words that should be mine will you swear never to marry but by my free leave then good my lords bear witness to his oath unless another as like hermione as is her picture affronts his eye i have done yet if my lord will marry if

to say you have seen a better how not women had our prince jewel of children seen this hour he had well with this lord there was not full a month between their births sir my liege your eye hath too much youth i not a month your queen died she was more worth such gazes than what you look on now what sovereign sir i did not well i meant well all my services you have paid home but that you have vouchsafed with your crown brother and these your contracted heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit it is a surplus of your grace which never my life may last to answer as she lived peerless so

to give the mother notice of my affair i humbly thank you commend me to my brother soon at night i send him certain word of my success good sir adieu exeunt i am a woeful suitor to your honour please but your honour hear me there is a vice that most i do abhor and most desire should meet the blow of justice for which i would not plead but that i must for which i must not plead but that i am at war will and will not i have a brother is condemn to die i do beseech you let it be his fault and not my brother o just but severe law i had a brother then heaven keep your honour must he needs die yes i do think that you might pardon him and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy but can you if you would but might you and do the world no wrong if so your heart were touch with that remorse as mine is to him too late why no i that do speak a word may call it back again well believe this no ceremony that to great ones not the king crown nor the deputed sword the marshal truncheon nor the judge robe become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does if he had been as you and you as he you would have slipt like him but he like you would not have been so stern i would to heaven i had your potency and you were isabel should it then be thus no i would tell what to be a judge and what a prisoner alas alas why all the souls that were were forfeit once and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy how would you be if he which is the top of judgement should but judge you as you are o think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made o that sudden spare him spare him he not prepared for death even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you who is it that hath died for this offence there many have committed it yet show some pity so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffers o it is excellent to have a giant strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle but man proud man drest in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal we can not weigh our brother with ourself great men may jest with saints is wit in them but in the less foul profanation that in the captain but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o the top go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know that like my brother fault if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brother life gentle my lord turn back hark how i bribe you good my lord turn back ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you not with fond shekels of the tested gold or stones whose rates are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere prayers from preserved souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal heaven keep your honour safe at what hour shall i attend your worship your honour exeunt isabella luclo and provost i am come to know your pleasure even so heaven keep your honour under your sentence when i beseech you that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not is set down so in heaven but not in earth sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul how say you please you to i take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit if that be sin i make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better so true as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death the impression of keen whips wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere my body up to shame and the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die for ever ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love else let my brother die if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for it i know your virtue hath a license i which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others ha little honour to be much believed and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretch throat i tell the world aloud what man thou art to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make to their will hooking both right and wrong to the appetite to follow as it draws i to my brother though he hath fall n by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honour that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorr pollution then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity i tell him yet of angelo request and fit his mind to death for his soul rest exit what ho peace here grace and good company my business is a word or two with claudio why as all comforts are most good most good indeed lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger therefore your best appointment make with speed you set on none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if you implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the world vastidity you had to a determined scope in such a one as you consenting would bark your honour from that trunk you bear and leave you naked o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour darest thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies there spake my brother there my father grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this deputy whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell o is the cunning livery of hell the body to invest and cover in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed yes he would thee from this rank offence so to offend him still this night the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest o were it but my life throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin be ready claudio for your death tomorrow which is the least what says my brother and shamed life a hateful alas alas o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest wretchl wilt thou be made a man out of my vice not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sister shame what should i think heaven shield my mother play my father fair for such a warped slip of wilderness issued from his blood take my defiance die perish might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed i pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee o fie fie fie thy sin not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd best that thou diest quickly what is your will he hath a garden circummured with brick whose western side is with a vineyard back and to that vineyard is a planched gate that makes his opening with this bigger key this other doth command a little door which from the vineyard to the garden leads there have i made my promise upon the heavy middle of the night to call upon him i have a due and wary note upo with whispering and most guilty diligence in action all of precept he did show me the way twice no none but only a repair i the dark and that i have possess him my most stay can be but brief for i have made him know i have a servant comes with me along that stays upon me whose persuasion is i come about my brother i do desire the like she take the enterprise upon her father if you advise it little have you to say when you depart from him but soft and low now my brother peace ho be here ho by your leave the better given me by so holy a man hath yet the deputy sent my brother pardon nay but it is not so o i will to him and pluck out his eyes unhappy claudio wretched isabel injurious world most damned angelo i am directed by you to speak so indirectly i am loath i would say the truth but to accuse him so that is your part yet i am advised to do it he says to veil full purpose besides he tells me that if peradventure he speak against me on the adverse side i should not think it strange for is a physic that bitter to sweet end o peace the friar is come enter friar peter justice o royal duke vail your regard upon a wrong i would fain have said a maid o worthy prince dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believed or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here by course of justice most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelo forsworn is it not strange that angelo a murderer not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a is it not strange and strange it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to the end of reckoning o prince i conjure thee as thou believest there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touch with madness make not impossible that which but seems unlike is not impossible but one the caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings characts titles forms be an believe it royal prince if he be less he nothing but he more had i more name for badness o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true i am the sister of one claudio condemn upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemn by angelo i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger that he indeed this gentleman told somewhat of my tale i went to this pernicious caitiff deputy pardon it the phrase is to the matter in brief to set the needless process by how i persuaded how i pray and kneel how he refell me and how i replied for this was of much length the vile conclusion i now begin with grief and shame to utter he would not but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust release my brother and after much debatement my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour and i did yield to him but the next morn betimes his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant for my poor brother head o that it were as like as it is true and is this all then o you blessed ministers above keep me in patience and with ripen time unfold the evil which is here up in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe as i thus wrong hence unbelieved go one that i would were here friar lodowick o give me pardon that i your vassal have employ and your unknown sovereignty i do my lord angelo mariana friar peter and provost most bounteous sir kneeling look if it please you on this man condemn as if my brother lived i partly think a due sincerity govern his deeds till he did look on me since it is so let him not die my brother had but justice in that he did the thing for which he died for angelo his act did not his bad intent and must be buried but as an intent that perish by the way thoughts are no subjects intents but merely thoughts break off thy song and haste thee quick away here comes a man of comfort whose advice hath often still my brawling discontent exit boy enter duke disguised as before i cry you mercy sir and well could wish you had not found me here so musical let me excuse me and believe me so my mirth it much displeased but pleased my woe good friar i know you do and have found it will please you walk aside exeunt mariana and isabella fear me not be ruled by him i would friar peter pardon my lord i will not show my face until my husband bid me my lord i do confess i was married and i confess besides i am no maid i have known my husband yet my husband knows not that ever he knew me now i come my lord she that accuses him of fornication in manner doth accuse my husband and charges him my lord with such a time when i depose i had him in mine arms with all the effect of love not that i know why just my lord and that is angelo who thinks he knows that he knew my body but knows he thinks that he knows isabel my husband bids me now i will unmask unveiling this is that face thou cruel angelo which once thou sworest was worth the looking on this is the hand which with a vow contract was fast belock in thine this is the body that took away the match from isabel and did supply thee at thy in her imagined person noble prince as there comes light from heaven and words from breath as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue i am affianced this man wife as strongly as words could make up vows and my good lord but tuesday night last gone in he knew me as a wife as this is true let me in safety raise me from my knees or else for ever be confixed here a marble monument o my most gracious lord i hope you will not mock me with a husband o my dear lord i crave no other nor no better man gentle my liege kneeling o my good lord sweet isabel take my part lend me your knees and all my life to come i lend you all my life to do you service isabel sweet isabel do yet but kneel by me hold up your hands say nothing i speak all they say best men are moulded out of faults and for the most become much more the better for being a little bad so may my husband o isabel will you not lend a knee merely my lord good margaret run thee to the parlor there shalt thou find my cousin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her ear and tell her i and ursula walk in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou us and bid her steal into the pleached bower where honeysuckles ripen by the sun forbid the sun to enter like favorites made proud by princes that advance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our purpose this is thy office bear thee well in it and leave us alone now ursula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley up and down our talk must only be of benedick when i do name him let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of this matter is little cupid crafty arrow made that only wounds by hearsay enter beatrice behind now begin for look where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to hear our conference then go we near her that her ear lose nothing of the false sweet bait that we lay for it approaching the bower no truly ursula she is too disdainful i know her spirits are as coy and wild as haggerds of the rock so says the prince and my newtrothed lord they did entreat me to acquaint her of it but i persuaded them if they loved benedick to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it o god of love i know he doth deserve as much as may be yielded to a man but nature never framed a woman heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprising what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she can not love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so why you speak truth i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featured but she would spell him backward if fairfaced she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antique made a foul blot if tall a lance if low an agate very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent why a block moved with none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth no not to be so odd and from all fashions as beatrice is can not be commendable but who dare tell her so if i should speak she would mock me into air o she would laugh me out of myself press me to death with wit therefore let benedick like cover fire consume away in sighs waste inwardly it were a better death than die with mocks which is as bad as die with tickling no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly i devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with one doth not know how much an ill word may empoison liking he is the only man of italy always excepted my dear claudio indeed he hath an excellent good name why every day come go in i show thee some attires and have thy counsel which is the best to furnish me if it proves so then loving goes by haps some cupid kills with arrows some with traps exeunt hero and ursula and seem i ever otherwise to you is my lord well that he doth speak so wide true o god o god defend me how am i beset what kind of catechising call you this is it not hero who can blot that name with any just reproach i talk with no man at that hour my lord they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man alive than that which maiden modesty doth warrant let all my sins lack mercy o my father prove you that any man with me conversed at hours unmeet or that i yesternight maintain the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death and when i lived i was your other wife unmasking and when you loved you were my other husband nothing certainer one hero died defiled but i do live and surely as i live i am a maid and here another writ in my cousin hand stolen from her pocket containing her affection unto benedick that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it for who digs hills because they do aspire throws down one mountain to cast up a higher o my distressed lord even such our griefs are here they but felt and seen with mischief eyes but like to groves being topp they higher rise i do my best sir o is too true our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it o your sweet queen that the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither to have bless mine eyes with her i have one myself who shall not be more dear to my respect than yours my lord thy oath remember thou hast sworn to but a blow which never shall be known thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon to yield thee so much profit let not conscience which is but cold inflaming love i thy bosom inflame too nicely nor let pity which even women have cast off melt thee but be a soldier to thy purpose how now marina why do you keep alone how chance my daughter is not with you do not consume your blood with sorrowing you have a nurse of me lord how your favor changed with this unprofitable woe come give me your flowers ere the sea mar it walk with leonine the air is quick there and it pierces and sharpens the stomach come leonine take her by the arm walk with her come come i love the king your father and yourself with more than foreign heart we every day expect him here when he shall come and find our paragon to all reports thus blasted he will repent the breadth of his great voyage blame both my lord and me that we have taken no care to your best courses go i pray you walk and be cheerful once again reserve that excellent complexion which did steal the eyes of young and old care not for me i can go home alone come come i know is good for you walk half an hour leonine at the least remember what i have said i leave you my sweet lady for a while pray walk softly do not heat your blood what i must have a care of you why are you foolish can it be undone i think you turn a child again that she is dead nurses are not the fates to foster it nor ever to preserve she died at night i say so who can cross it unless you play the pious innocent and for an honest attribute cry out died by foul play be one of those that think the petty wrens of tarsus will fly hence and open this to pericles i do shame to think of what a noble strain you are and of how coward a spirit be it so then yet none does know but you how she came dead nor none can know leonine being gone she did distain my child and stood between her and her fortunes none would look on her but cast their gazes on marina face whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin not worth the time of day it pierced me thorough and though you call my course unnatural you not your child well loving yet i find it greets me as an enterprise of kindness perform to your sole daughter and as for pericles what should he say we wept after her hearse and yet we mourn her monument is almost finish and her epitaphs in glittering golden characters express a general praise to her and care in us at whose expense is done you are like one that superstitiously doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies but yet i know you do as i advise exeunt no i will rob tellus of her weed to strew thy green with flowers the yellows blues the purple violets and marigolds shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave while do last ay me poor maid born in a tempest when my mother died this world to me is like a lasting storm whirring me from my friends no i pray you i not bereave you of your servant well i will go but yet i have no desire to it my thanks sweet madam

clasping to the mast endured a sea that almost burst the deck when i was born never was waves nor wind more violent and from the washes off a says one out and with a dropping industry they skip from stem to stern the boatswain whistles and the master calls and trebles their confusion what mean you why will you kill me why would she have me kill now as i can remember by my troth i never did her hurt in all my life i never spake bad word nor did ill turn to any living creature believe me la i never kill a mouse nor hurt a fly i trod upon a worm against my will but i wept for it how have i offended wherein my death might yield her any profit or my life imply her any danger you will not for all the world i hope you are well favor and your looks foreshow you have a gentle heart i saw you lately when you caught hurt in parting two that fought good sooth it show well in you do so now your lady seeks my life come you between and save poor me the weaker alack that leonine was so slack so slow he should have struck not spoke or that these pirates not enough barbarous had not thrown me for to seek my mother if fires be hot knives sharp or waters deep untied i still my virgin knot will keep diana aid my purpose if you were born to honor show it now if put upon you make the judgement good that thought you worthy of it for me that am a maid though most ungentle fortune have placed me in this sty where since i came diseases have been sold dearer than physic o that the gods would set me free from this unhallow place though they did change me to the meanest bird that flies i the purer air the good gods preserve you neither of these are so bad as thou art since they do better thee in their command thou a place for which the fiend of hell would not in reputation change thou art

would own a name too dear o that the gods would safely deliver me from this place here here gold for thee if that thy master would gain by me proclaim that i can sing weave sew and dance with other virtues which i keep from boast and i will undertake all these to teach i doubt not but this populous city will yield many scholars prove that i can not take me home again and prostitute me to the

fortune did malign my state my derivation was from ancestors who stood equivalent with mighty kings but time hath rooted out my parentage and to the world and awkward casualties bound me in servitude

yet i was mortally brought forth and am no other than i appear where i am but a stranger from the deck you may discern the place if i should tell my history it would seem like lies disdain in the reporting so indeed i did some such thing i said and said no more but what my thoughts did warrant me was likely my name is marina patience good sir or here i cease the name was given me by one that

short of thanks for my great suit so easily obtain i understand you not my griefs are double we have received your letters full of love your favors the ambassadors of love and in our maiden council rated them at courtship pleasant jest and courtesy as bombast and as lining to the time but more devout than this in our respects have we not been and therefore met your loves in their own fashion like a merriment a time methinks too short to make a bargain in no no my lord your grace is perjured much full of dear guiltiness and therefore this if for my love as there is no such cause you will do aught this shall you do for me your oath i will not trust but go with speed to some forlorn and naked hermitage remote from all the pleasures of the world there stay until the twelve celestial signs have brought about the annual reckoning if this austere insociable life change not your offer made in heat of blood if frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love but that it bear this trial and last love then at the expiration of the year come challenge me challenge me by these deserts and by this virgin palm now kissing thine i will be thine and till that instant shut my woeful self up in a mourning house raining the tears of lamentation for the remembrance of my father death if this thou do deny let our hands part neither intitled in the other heart ay sweet my lord and so i take my leave was not that hector another of these students at that time was there with him if i have heard a truth biron they call him but a merrier man within the limit of becoming mirth i never spent an hour talk withal his eye begets occasion for his wit for every object that the one doth catch the other turns to a jest which his fair tongue conceit expositor delivers in such apt and gracious words that aged ears play truant at his tales and younger hearings are quite ravished so sweet and voluble is his discourse did not i dance with you in brabant once how needless was it then to ask the question is of you that spur me with such questions not till it leave the rider in the mire no point with my knife and yours from long living thou art an old and speakest skilfully then was venus like her mother for her father is but grim ay our way to be gone shall i teach you to know why she that bears the bow finely put off well then i am the shooter if we choose by the horns yourself come not near finely put on indeed thou canst not hit it hit it hit it thou canst not hit it my good man madame came nothing else along with that that was the way to make his godhead wax for he hath been five thousand years a boy you be friends with him a kill your sister what your dark meaning mouse of this light word we need more light to find your meaning out look what you do you do it still i the dark indeed i weigh not you and therefore light great reason for cure is still past care i would you knew an if my face were but as fair as yours my favour were as great be witness this nay i have verses too i thank biron the numbers true and were the numbering too i were the fairest goddess on the ground i am compared to twenty thousand fairs o he hath drawn my picture in his letter much in the letters nothing in the praise pencils ho let me not die your debtor my red dominical my golden letter o that your face were not so full of o they are worse fools to purchase mocking so that same biron i torture ere i go o that i knew he were but in by the week how i would make him fawn and beg and seek and wait the season and observe the times and spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes and shape his service wholly to my hests and make him proud to make me proud that jests so would i his state that he should be my fool and i his fate the blood of youth burns not with such excess as gravity revolt to wantonness come on then wear the favours most in sight but shall we dance if they desire us to what would these strangers know their minds boyet if they do speak our language is our will that some plain man recount their purposes know what they would what would they say they why that they have and bid them so be gone it is not so ask them how many inches is in one mile if they have measured many the measure then of one is easily told how many weary steps of many weary miles you have are number in the travel of one mile my face is but a moon and clouded too o vain petitioner beg a greater matter thou now but moonshine in the water play music then nay you must do it soon music plays not yet no dance thus change i like the moon you took the moon at full but now she changed our ears vouchsafe it since you are strangers and come here by chance we not be nice take hands we will not dance only to part friends curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends we can afford no more at such a price your absence only then can not we be bought and so adieu twice to your visor and half once to you in private then not one word more my maids break off break off wits they have gross gross fat fat o they were all in lamentable cases the king was for a good word well better wits have worn plain but will you hear the king is my love sworn good madam if by me you be advised let mock them still as well known as disguised let us complain to them what fools were here disguised like muscovites in shapeless gear and wonder what they were and to what end their shallow shows and prologue vilely and their rough carriage so ridiculous should be presented at our tent to us madam speak true it is not so my lord my lady to the manner of the days in courtesy gives undeserving praise we four indeed confronted were with four in russian habit here they stay an hour and talk apace and in that hour my lord they did not bless us with one happy word i dare not call them fools but this i think when they are thirsty fools would fain have drink this proves you wise and rich for in my eye but that you take what doth to you belong it were a fault to snatch words from my tongue all the fool mine which of the vizards was it that you wore there then that vizard that superfluous case that hid the worse and show the better face help hold his brows he swoon why look you pale i think coming from muscovy sans sans i pray you it is not so for how can this be true that you stand forfeit being those that sue nor shall not if i do as i intend madam he swore that he did hold me dear as precious eyesight and did value me above this world adding thereto moreover that he would wed me or else die my lover by heaven you did and to confirm it plain you gave me this but take it sir again we did not quote them so you must be purged too your sins are rack you are attaint with faults and perjury therefore if you my favour mean to get a twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest but seek the weary beds of people sick oft have i heard of you my lord biron before i saw you and the world large tongue proclaims you for a man replete with mocks full of comparisons and wounding flouts which you on all estates will execute that lie within the mercy of your wit to weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain and therewithal to win me if you please without the which i am not to be won you shall this twelvemonth term from day to day visit the speechless sick and still converse with groaning wretches and your task shall be with all the fierce endeavour of your wit to enforce the pained impotent to smile why that the way to choke a gibing spirit whose influence is begot of that loose grace which shallow laughing hearers give to fools a jest prosperity lies in the ear of him that hears it never in the tongue of him that makes it then if sickly ears deaf with the clamors of their own dear groans will hear your idle scorns continue then and i will have you and that fault withal but if they will not throw away that spirit and i shall find you empty of that fault right joyful of your reformation good hamlet cast thy nighted color off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou is common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity

grained spots as will not leave their tinct o speak to me no more these words like daggers enter in mine ears no more sweet hamlet no more alas he mad alas how with you that you do bend your eye on

what would she have let her come in exit horatio to my sick soul as sin true nature is each toy seems prologue to some great amiss so full of artless jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be split horatio with ophelia how now ophelia alas sweet lady what imports this song alack what noise is this how cheerfully on the false trail they cry o this is counter you false danish dogs calmly good laertes but not by him one woe doth tread upon another heel so fast they follow your sister drowned laertes there is a willow grows aslant a brook that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream there with fantastic garlands did she come of nettles daisies and long purples that liberal shepherds give a grosser name but our cold maids do dead men fingers call them there on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds clambering to hang an envious sliver broke when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook her clothes spread wide and awhile they bore her up which time she chanted snatches of old tunes as one incapable of her own distress or like a creature native and indued unto that element but long it could not be till that her garments heavy with their drink pull the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death drown drown sweets to the sweet farewell scattering flowers i hoped thou shouldst have been my hamlet wife i thought thy to have deck sweet maid and not have strew thy grave hamlet hamlet o my son what theme for love of god forbear him this is mere madness and thus awhile the fit will work on him anon as patient as the female dove when that

pardon me come let me wipe thy face no no the drink the drink o my dear hamlet the drink the drink i am poison dies do you doubt that no more but so i shall the effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whiles like a puff and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede is in my memory locked and you yourself shall keep the key of it so please you something touching the lord hamlet he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me i do not know my lord what i should think my lord he hath importuned me with love in honorable fashion and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven i shall obey my lord exeunt o my lord my lord i have been so affrighted my lord as i was sewing in my closet lord hamlet with his doublet all unbraced no hat upon his head his stockings foul ungarter and to his ancle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors comes before me my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he raised a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn he seem to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their helps and to the last bended their light on me no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me madam i wish it may exit queen good my lord how does your honor for this many a day my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to i pray you now receive them my honor lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath composed as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord o what a noble mind is here thrown the courtier soldier scholar eye tongue sword the expectancy and rose of the fair state the glass of fashion and the mould of form the observed of all observers quite quite down and i of ladies most deject and wretched that suck the honey of his music vows now see that noble and most sovereign reason like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh that unmatch form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me to have seen what i have seen see what i see king and polonius where is the beauteous majesty of denmark how should i your true love know from another one by his cockle hat and staff and his sandal shoon he is dead and

the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalued persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscribed unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosed and in the morn and

beam o rose of may dear maid kind sister sweet ophelia o heavens possible a young maid wits should be as moral as an old man life nature is fine in love and where is fine it sends some precious

and discourse since i am put to know that your own science exceeds in that the lists of all advice my strength can give you then no more remains but that to your sufficiency your worth is able and let them work the nature of our people our city institutions and the terms for common justice you as pregnant in as art and practice hath enriched any that we remember there is our commission from which we would not have you warp call hither i say bid come before us angelo exit an attendant what figure of us think you he will bear for you must know we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dress him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power what think you of it look where he comes enter angelo angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to the observer doth thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us all alike as if we had them not spirits are not finely but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise hold therefore angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart old escalus though first in question is thy secondary take thy commission no more evasion we have with a leaven and prepared choice proceeded to you therefore take your honours our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and leaves matters of needful value we shall write to you as time and our concernings shall importune how it goes with us and do look to know what doth befall you here so fare you well to the hopeful execution do i leave you of your commissions my haste may not admit it nor need you on mine honour have to do with any scruple your scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good give me your hand i privily away i love the

fare you well i thank you fare you well exit no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbour hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps i have deliver to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me travell to poland for so i have strew it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this nineteen years we have let slip even like an lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threatening twigs of birch only to stick it in their children sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mock than fear so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum i do fear too dreadful sith was my fault to give the people scope be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in the ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar moe reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be exeunt hail to you provost so i think you are bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly when must he die

your most offenceful act was mutually committed then was your sin of heavier kind than his is meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear there rest your partner as i hear must die and i am going with instruction to him grace go with you benedicite exit so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that dost this habitation where thou hourly afflict merely thou art death fool for him thou by thy flight to shun and yet toward him still thou art not noble for all the accommodations that thou are nursed by baseness by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provokes yet grossly thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get and what thou hast thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an sleep dreaming on both for ail thy blessed youth becomes as aged and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant what yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes

with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland what the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another what their seeking hang they say they sit by the fire and presume to know what done i the capitol who like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say there grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword make a quarry with thousands of these quarter slaves as high as i could pick my lance they are dissolved hang they said they were sigh forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answer and a petition granted them a strange to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o the moon shouting their emulation five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice one junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know the rabble should have first unroof the city ere so prevail with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection arguing go get you home you fragments enter a messenger hastily here what the matter i am glad o then we shall ha means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders enter cominius titus lartius and other senators junius brutus and sicinius velutus they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you i sin in envying his nobility and were i any thing but what i am i would wish me only he were half to half the world by the ears and he upon my party revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus face what art thou stiff out nay let them follow the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners your valour puts well forth pray follow citizens steal away exeunt all but sicinius and brutus yonder comes news a wager they have met is done say has our general met the enemy i buy him of you how far off lie these armies then shall we hear their and they ours now mars i prithee make us quick in work that we with smoking swords may march from hence to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast they sound a parley enter two senators with others on the walls tullus aufidius is he within your walls o they are at it they fear us not but issue forth their city now put your shields before your hearts and fight with hearts more proof than shields advance brave titus they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts which makes me sweat with wrath come on my fellows he that retires i take him for a volsce and he shall feel mine edge alarum the romans are beat back to their trenches marcius cursing all the contagion of the south light on you you shames of rome you herd and plagues plaster you that you may be further than seen and one infect another against the wind a mile you souls of geese that bear the shapes of men how have you run from slaves that apes would beat pluto and hell all hurt behind backs red and faces pale with fright and agued fear mend and charge home or by the fires of heaven i leave the foe and make my wars on you look come on if you stand fast we beat them to their wives as they us to our trenches followed another alarum the volsces fly and marcius follows them to the gates so now the gates are ope now prove good seconds for the followers fortune widens them not for the fliers mark me and do the like enters the gates see here these movers that do prize their hours at a crack drachma cushions leaden spoons irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them these base slaves ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them and hark what noise the general makes to him there is the man of my soul hate aufidius piercing our romans then valiant titus take convenient numbers to make good the city whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste to help cominius sir praise me not my work hath yet not warm me fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me to aufidius thus i will appear and fight thy friend no less than those she placeth highest so farewell come i too late come i too late o let me clip ye in arms as sound as when i woo in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burn to bedward as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threatening the other holding corioli in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will let him alone he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen the common plague tribunes for them the mouse shunn the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they will the time serve to tell i do not think where is the enemy are you lords o the field if not why cease you till you are so how lies their battle know you on which side they have placed their men of trust i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by the blood we have shed together by the vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanced and darts we prove this very hour those are they that most are willing if any such be as it were sin to love this painting wherein you see me smear if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow marcius they all shout and wave their swords take him up in their arms and cast up their caps o me alone make you a sword of me if these shows be not outward which of you but is four volsces none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his a certain number though thanks to all must i select from all the rest shall bear the business in some other fight as cause will be obey please you to march and four shall quickly draw out my command which men are best inclined i fight with none but thee for i do hate thee worse than a let the first budger die the other slave and the gods doom him after within these three hours tullus alone i fought in your corioli walls and made what work i pleased is not my blood wherein thou seest me mask for thy revenge wrench up thy power to the highest pray now no more my mother who has a charter to extol her blood when she does praise me grieves me i have done as you have done that what i can induced as you have been that for my country he that has but effected his good will hath mine act i have some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves remember i thank you general but can not make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing a long flourish they all cry marcius cast up their caps and lances cominius and lartius stand bare may these same instruments which you profane never sound more when drums and trumpets shall i the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be made all of soothing when steel grows soft as the parasite silk let him be made a coverture for the wars no more i say for that i have not my nose that bled or foil some debile wretch which without note here many else have done you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies i will go wash and when my face is fair you shall perceive whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you i mean to stride your steed and at all times to undercrest your good addition to the fairness of my power the gods begin to mock me i that now refused most princely gifts am bound to beg of my lord general i sometime lay here in corioli at a poor man house he used me kindly he cried to me i saw him prisoner but then aufidius was within my view and wrath my pity i request you to give my poor host freedom by jupiter forgot i am weary yea my memory is tired have we no wine here no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more o you have i know petition all the gods for my prosperity kneels my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laugh had i come coffin home that to see me triumph ah my dear such eyes the widows in corioli wear and mothers that lack sons and live you yet to valeria o my sweet lady pardon menenius ever ever your hand and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head the good patricians must be visited from whom i have received not only greetings but with them change of honours know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs your honours pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothed not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monster exit i do owe them still my life and services i do beseech you let me that custom for i can not put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them the unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only what must i say i pray sir upo i can not bring my tongue to such a pace sir my wounds i got them in my country service when some certain of your brethren roar and ran from the noise of our own drums think upon me hang i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean two of the citizens so here comes a brace a third citizen you know the cause sir of my standing here most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this woolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless vouches custom calls me to what custom wills in all things should we do the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heapt for truth to rather than fool it so let the high office and the honour go to one that would do this i am half through the one part suffer the other will i do three citizens more here come more voices your voices for your voices i have fought watch for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul is this done where at the may i change these garments that i straight do and knowing myself again repair to the tullus aufidius then had made new head so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upon again saw you aufidius spoke he of me how what at antium lives he i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home enter sicinius and brutus behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o the common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance ha what is that what makes this change have i had children voices are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffer and live with such as can not rule nor ever will be ruled why this was known before have you inform them sithence why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speak now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable many let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have plough for sow and scatter by mingling them with us the honour number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tetter us yet sought the very way to catch them choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove be my mind shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory being but the horn and noise o the monster wants not spirit to say he turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learn be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his his popular against a graver bench than ever frown in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter the gap of both and take the one by the other whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o the storehouse gratis as was used sometime in greece though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourish disobedience fed the ruin of the state i give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured they did service being press to the war even when the navel of the state was touch they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i the war their mutinies and revolts wherein they most valour spoke not for them the accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the motive of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bisson multitude digest the senate courtesy let deeds express what like to be their words did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom can not conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barr it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change o that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonour mangles true judgement and bereaves the state of that integrity which should not having the power to do the good it would for the ill which doth thou wretch despite thee what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to the greater bench in a rebellion when what not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i the dust hence old goat hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments no i die here drawing his sword there some among you have beheld me fighting come try upon yourselves what you have seen me i would they were they are though in rome they are not though calved i the porch o the on fair ground i could beat forty of them let them pull all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woollen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war enter volumnia i talk of you why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am let go let them hang what must i do well what then what then for them i can not do it to the gods must i then to them tush tush why force you this must i go show them my unbarbed sconce must i with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will yet were there but this single plot to lose this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it and throw against the wind to the marketplace you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life well i must away my disposition and possess me some harlot spirit my throat of war be turn which quired with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggar tongue make motion through my lips and my arm knees who bow but in my stirrup bend like his that hath received an alms i will not lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my body action teach my mind a most inherent baseness pray be content mother i am going to the chide me no more i mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home beloved of all the trades in rome look i am going commend me to my wife i return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i the way of flattery further the word is pray you let us go let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honour well mildly be it then mildly exeunt ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece will bear the knave by the volume the honour gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men plant love among throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war first hear me speak shall i be charged no further than this present must all determine here i am content scratches with briers scars to move laughter only what is the matter that being pass for consul with full voice i am so dishonour that the very hour you take it off again say then is true i ought so how traitor the fires i the lowest hell the people call me their traitor thou injurious tribune within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hands clutch as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say liest unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods what do you prate of service you i know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death vagabond exile flaying pent to linger but with a grain a day i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word nor check my courage for what they can give to with saying morrow you common cry of curs whose breath i hate as reek o the rotten fens whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air i banish you and here remain with your uncertainty let every feeble rumour shake your hearts your enemies with nodding of their plumes fan you into despair have the power still to banish your defenders

safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower because my name is george yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the plucks the letter g and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he these as i learn and such like toys as these have moved his highness to commit me now by heaven i think there no man is secure but the queen kindred and heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore heard ye not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey i know it pleaseth neither of us well i must perforce farewell exeunt clarence brakenbury and guard o i have pass a miserable night so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embark to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches thence we looked toward england and cited up a thousand fearful times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befall n us as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main lord lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears what ugly sights of death within mine eyes methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks ten thousand men that fishes gnaw upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scatter in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead men skulls and in those holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as in scorn of eyes reflecting gems which woo the slimy bottom of the deep and mock the dead bones that lay scatter by methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood kept in my soul and would not let it forth to seek the empty vast and wandering air but smother it within my panting bulk which almost burst to belch it in the sea o no my dream was lengthen after life o then began the tempest to my soul who pass methought the melancholy flood with that grim ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great renowned warwick who cried aloud scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence and so he vanish then came wandering by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he squeak out aloud is come false fleeting perjured clarence that stabb me in the field by tewksbury seize on him furies take him to your torments with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environ me about and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling awaked and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made the dream o brakenbury i have done those things which now bear evidence against my soul for edward sake and see how he requites me o god if my deep prayers can not appease thee but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine in god name what art thou but not as i am royal thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak your eyes do menace me why look you pale who sent you hither wherefore do you come to murder me you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore can not have the hearts to do it wherein my friends have i offended you i shall be reconciled to him again are you call forth from out a world of men to slay the innocent what is my offence where are the evidence that do accuse me what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence death before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christ dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me the deed you undertake is damnable erroneous vassal the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then spurn at his edict and fulfil a man take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands to hurl upon their heads that break his law alas for whose sake did i that ill deed for edward for my brother for his sake why sirs he sends ye not to murder me for this for in this sin he is as deep as i if god will be revenged for this deed o know you yet he doth it publicly take not the quarrel from his powerful arm he needs no indirect nor lawless course to cut off those that have offended him my brother love the devil and my rage oh if you love my brother hate not me i am his brother and i love him well if you be hired for meed go back again and i will send you to my brother gloucester who shall reward you better for my life than edward will for tidings of my death o no he loves me and he holds me dear go you to him from me tell him when that our princely father york bless his three sons with his victorious arm and charged us from his soul to love each other he little thought of this divided friendship bid gloucester think of this and he will weep o do not slander him for he is kind it can not be for when i parted with him he hugg me in his arms and swore with sobs that he would labor my delivery hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul to counsel me to make my peace with god and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind that thou wilt war with god by murdering me ah sirs consider he that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed relent and save your souls not to relent is beastly savage devilish which of you if you were a prince son being pent from liberty as i am now if two such murderers as yourselves came to you would not entreat for life my friend i spy some pity in thy looks o if thine eye be not a flatterer come thou on my side and entreat for me as you would beg were you in my distress a begging prince what beggar pities not fellows stand fast i see a passenger if there be ten shrink not but down with enter valentine

whether a maid so tender fair and happy so opposite to marriage that she the wealthy curled darlings of our nation would ever have to incur a general mock run from her guardage to the sooty bosom of such a thing as thou to fear not to delight judge me the world if is not gross in sense that thou hast practised on her with foul charms abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals that weaken motion i disputed on probable and palpable to thinking i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world a practiser of arts inhibited and out of warrant lay hold upon him if he do resist subdue him at his peril to prison till fit time of law and course of direct session call thee to answer how the duke in council in this time of the night bring him away mine not an idle cause

grace pardon me neither my place nor aught i heard of business hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care take hold on me for my particular grief is of so and nature that it engluts and swallows other sorrows and it is still itself my daughter o my daughter ay to me she is abused stol n from me and corrupted by spells and medicines bought of mountebanks for nature so preposterously to err being not deficient blind or lame of sense sans witchcraft could not humbly i thank your grace here is the man this moor whom now it seems your special mandate for the hath hither brought nothing but this is so a maiden never bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blush at herself and she in spite of nature of years of country credit every thing to fall in love with what she fear to look on it is a judgement maim and most imperfect that will confess perfection so could err against all rules of nature and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be i therefore vouch again that with some mixtures powerful the blood or with some dram conjured to this effect he wrought upon her i pray you hear her speak if she confess that she was half the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man come hither gentle mistress do you perceive in all this noble company where most you owe obedience god be wi you i have done please it your

jewel i am glad at soul i have no other child for thy escape would teach me tyranny to hang clogs on them i have done my lord so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well that nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruised heart was pierced through the ear i humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state i not have it so look to her moor if thou hast eyes to see she has deceived her father and may thee exeunt duke senators officers c with due observance of thy godlike seat great agamemnon nestor shall apply thy latest words in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boasts dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of nobler bulk but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis and anon behold the bark through liquid mountains cut bounding between the two moist elements like perseus horse where then the saucy boat whose weak untimber sides but even now greatness either to harbor fled or made a toast for neptune even so doth valor show and valor worth divide in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks and flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage as roused with rage doth sympathize and with an accent tuned in selfsame key retorts to chiding fortune most wisely hath ulysses here the fever whereof all our power is sick and in the imitation of these twain who as ulysses says opinion crowns with an imperial voice many are infect ajax is grown and bears his head in such a rein in full as proud a place as broad achilles keeps his tent like him makes factious feasts rails on our state of war bold as an oracle and sets thersites a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint to match us in comparisons with dirt to weaken and discredit our exposure how rank soever rounded in with danger let this be granted and achilles horse makes many thetis sons a tucket tell him of nestor one that was a man when hector grandsire suck he is old now but if there be not in our grecian host one noble man that hath one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me i hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this wither brawn and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world his youth in flood i prove this truth with my three drops of blood what says ulysses what well and how the purpose is perspicuous even as substance whose grossness little characters sum up and in the publication make no strain but that achilles were his brain as barren as banks of libya though apollo knows dry enough will with great speed of judgement ay with celerity find hector purpose pointing on him yes is most meet whom may you else oppose that can from hector bring his honor off if not achilles be a sportful combat yet in the trial much opinion dwells for here the trojans taste our repute with their finest palate and trust to me ulysses our imputation shall be oddly poised in this wild action for the success although particular shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general and in such indexes although small pricks to their subsequent volumes there is seen the baby figure of the giant mass of things to come at large it is supposed he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice being mutual act of all our souls makes merit her election and doth boil as from forth us all a man distill out of our virtues who miscarrying what heart receives from hence the conquering part to steel a strong opinion to themselves which entertain limbs are his instruments in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs i see them not with my old eyes what are they ulysses now i begin to relish thy advice and i will give a taste of it forthwith to agamemnon go we to him straight two curs shall tame each other pride alone must tarre the mastiffs on as their bone exeunt yet he loves himself not strange aside ulysses aside to dio o this is well he rubs the vein of him wherefore should you so he is not emulous as achilles is what a vice were it in ajax now ay my good son would you my lord aught with the general nothing my lord our general doth salute you with a kiss and very courtly counsel i much for nestor a woman of quick sense how ajax hold thine own i have thou gallant trojan seen thee oft laboring for destiny make cruel way through ranks of greekish youth and i have seen thee as hot as perseus spur thy phrygian steed despising many forfeits and subduements when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i the air not letting it decline on the declined that i have said to some my standers by jupiter is yonder dealing life and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath when that a ring of greeks have hemm thee in like an olympian wrestling this have i seen but this thy countenance still lock in steel i never saw till now i knew thy grandsire and once fought with him he was a soldier good but by great mars the captain of us all never like thee let an old man embrace thee and worthy warrior welcome to our tents i would my arms could match thee in contention as they contend with thee in courtesy ha by this white beard fight with thee tomorrow well welcome welcome i have seen the time go bear patroclus body to achilles and bid the ajax arm for shame there is a thousand hectors in the field now here he fights on galathe his horse and there lacks work anon he there afoot and there they fly or die like scaled sculls before the belching whale then is he yonder and there the strawy greeks ripe for his edge fall down before him like the mower swath here there and every where he leaves and takes dexterity so obeying appetite that what he will he does and does so much that proof is call impossibility enter ulysses so so we draw together enter achilles peace drums within achilles achilles hector slain achilles young prince of tyre you have at large received the danger of

mutual stand their savage eyes turn to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since nought so stockish hard and full of rage

fearing lest my jealous aim might err and so unworthily disgrace the man a rashness that i ever yet have shunn i gave him gentle looks thereby to find that which thyself hast now disclosed to me and that thou mayest perceive my fear of this knowing that tender youth is soon suggested i nightly lodge her in an upper tower the key whereof myself have ever kept and thence she can not be convey away upon mine honour he shall never know that i had any light from thee of this sir valentine whither away so fast be they of much import nay then no matter stay with me awhile i am to break with thee of some affairs that touch me near wherein thou must be secret is not unknown to thee that i have sought to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter no trust me she is peevish sullen froward proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty neither regarding that she is my child nor fearing me as if i were her father and may i say to thee this pride of hers upon advice hath drawn my love from her and where i thought the remnant of mine age should have been cherish by her duty i now am full resolved to take a wife and turn her out to who will take her in then let her beauty be her for me and my possessions she esteems not there is a lady in verona here whom i affect but she is nice and coy and nought esteems my aged eloquence now therefore would i have thee to my tutor for long agone i have forgot to court besides the fashion of the time is changed how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her eye but she did scorn a present that i sent her but she i mean is promised by her friends unto a youthful gentleman of worth and kept severely from resort of men that no man hath access by day to her ay but the doors be lock and keys kept safe that no man hath recourse to her by night her chamber is aloft far from the ground and built so shelving that one can not climb it without apparent hazard of his life now as thou art a gentleman of blood advise me where i may have such a ladder this very night for love is like a child that longs for everything that he can come by but hark thee i will go to her alone how shall i best convey the ladder thither a cloak as long as thine

match between sir thurio and my daughter and also i think thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will ay and perversely she persevers so what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio ay but she think that it is spoke in hate then you must undertake to slander him where your good word can not advantage him your slander can not endamage him therefore the office is indifferent being entreated to it by your friend and proteus we dare trust you in this kind because we know on valentine report you are already love firm votary and can not soon revolt and change your mind upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large for she is lumpish heavy melancholy and for your friend sake will be glad of you where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend ay much is the force of poesy this discipline shows thou hast been in love about it gentlemen even now about it i will pardon

monster envy oft the wrack of earned praise marina life seeks to take off by treason knife and in this kind hath our cleon one daughter and a wench full grown even ripe for this maid hight philoten and it is said for certain in our story she would ever with marina be when she weaved the sleided silk with fingers long small white as milk or when she would with sharp needle wound the cambric which she made more sound by hurting it or when to the lute she sung and made the mute that still records with moan or when she would with rich and constant pen vail to her mistress dian still this philoten contends in skill with absolute marina so with the dove of paphos might the crow vie feathers white marina gets all praises which are paid as debts and not as given this so darks in philoten all

cleon and dionyza see how belief may suffer by foul show this borrow passion stands for true old woe and pericles in sorrow all devour with sighs shot through and biggest tears leaves tarsus and again embarks he swears never to wash his face nor cut his hairs he puts on sackcloth and to sea he bears a tempest which his mortal vessel tears and yet he rides it out now please you wit the epitaph is

time than i do now with thought of such affections step forth mine advocate at your request my father will grant precious things as trifles hail you anointed deputies of heaven to thee king john my holy errand is i pandulph of fair milan cardinal and from pope innocent the legate here do in his name religiously demand why thou against the church our holy mother so wilfully dost spurn and force perforce keep stephen langton chosen archbishop of canterbury from that holy see this in our aforesaid holy father name pope innocent i do demand of thee then by the lawful power that i have thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate and blessed shall he be that doth revolt from his allegiance to an heretic and meritorious shall that hand be call canonized and worshipp as a saint that takes away by any secret course thy hateful life there law and warrant lady for my curse philip of france on peril of a curse let go the hand of that and raise the power of france upon his head unless he do submit himself to rome what canst thou say but will perplex thee more if thou stand excommunicate and cursed all form is formless order orderless save what is opposite to england love therefore to arms be champion of our church or let the church our mother breathe her curse a mother curse on her revolting son france thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue a chafed lion by the mortal paw a fasting tiger safer by the tooth than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold so makest thou faith an enemy to faith and like a civil war oath to oath thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow first made to heaven first be to heaven perform that is to be the champion of our church what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself and may not be performed by thyself for that which thou hast sworn to do amiss is not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where doing tends to ill the truth is then most done not doing it the better act of purposes mistook is to mistake again though indirect yet indirection thereby grows direct and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire within the scorched veins of one it is a religion that doth make vows kept but thou hast sworn against religion but what thou against the thing thou and makest an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear swears only not to be forsworn else what a mockery should it be to swear but thou dost swear only to be forsworn and most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear therefore thy later vows against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself and better conquest never canst thou make than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts against these giddy loose suggestions upon which better part our prayers come in if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know the peril of our course light on thee so heavy as thou shalt not shake them off but in despair die under their black weight i will denounce a curse upon his head courage and comfort all shall yet go well lady you utter madness and not sorrow you hold too heinous a respect of grief before the curing of a strong disease even in the instant of repair and health the fit is strongest evils that take leave on their departure most of all show evil what have you lost by losing of this day if you had won it certainly you had no no when fortune means to men most good she looks upon them with a threatening eye is strange to think how much king john hath lost in this which he accounts so clearly won are not you grieved that arthur is his prisoner your mind is all as youthful as your blood now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit for even the breath of what i mean to speak shall blow each dust each straw each little rub out of the path which shall directly lead thy foot to england throne and therefore mark john hath seized arthur and it can not be that whiles warm life plays in that infant veins the misplaced john should entertain an hour one minute nay one quiet breath of rest a sceptre snatch with an unruly hand must be as boisterously maintain as gain and he that stands upon a slippery place makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up that john may stand then arthur needs must fall so be it for it can not be but so you in the right of lady blanch your wife may then make all the claim that arthur did how green you are and fresh in this old world john lays you plots the times conspire with you for he that steeps his safety in true blood shall find but bloody safety and untrue this act so evilly born shall cool the hearts of all his people and freeze up their zeal that none so small advantage shall step forth to check his reign but they will cherish it no natural exhalation in the sky no scope of nature no distemper day no common wind no customed event but they will pluck away his natural cause and call them meteors prodigies and signs abortives presages and tongues of heaven plainly denouncing vengeance upon john o sir when he shall hear of your approach if that young arthur be not gone already even at that news he dies and then the hearts of all his people shall revolt from him and kiss the lips of unacquainted change and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath out of the bloody fingers ends of john methinks i see this hurly all on foot and o what better matter breeds for you than i have named the bastard faulconbridge is now in england ransacking the church offending charity if but a dozen french were there in arms they would be as a call to train ten thousand english to their or as a little snow tumbled about anon becomes a mountain o noble dauphin go with me to the king is wonderful what may be wrought out of their discontent now that their souls are topfull of offence for england go i will whet on the king take again from this my hand as holding of the pope your sovereign greatness and authority it was my breath that blew this tempest up upon your stubborn usage of the pope but since you are a gentle convertite my tongue shall hush again this storm of war and make fair weather in your blustering land on this remember well upon your oath of service to the pope go i to make the french lay down their arms exit hail noble prince of france the next is this king john hath reconciled himself to rome his spirit is come in that so stood out against the holy church the great metropolis and see of rome therefore thy threatening colors now wind up and tame the savage spirit of wild war that like a lion foster up at hand it may lie gently at the foot of peace and be no further harmful than in show you look but on the outside of this work the dauphin is too and will not temporize with my entreaties he flatly says he not lay down his arms give me leave to speak how like a fawning publican he looks i hate him for he is a christian but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis and brings down the rate of usance here with us in venice if i can catch him once upon the hip i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him he

lives sweetness that we the pain of death would hourly die rather than die at once taught me to shift into a madman rags to assume a semblance that very dogs disdain and in this habit met i my father with his bleeding rings their precious stones new lost became his guide led him begg for him saved him from despair never o fault reveal myself unto him until some past when i was arm not sure though hoping of this good success i ask his blessing and from first to last told him my pilgrimage but his flaw heart alack too weak the conflict to support two extremes of passion joy and grief burst smilingly this would have seem a period to such as love not sorrow but another to amplify too much would make much more and top extremity whilst i was big in clamour came there in a man who having seen me in my worst estate shunn my abhorr society but then finding who was that so endured with his strong arms he fasten on my neck and bellow out as burst heaven threw him on my father told the most piteous tale of lear and him that ever ear received which in recounting his grief grew puissant and the strings of life began to crack twice then the trumpets sounded and there i left him tranced kent sir the banish kent who in disguise follow his enemy king and did him service improper for a slave enter a gentleman with a bloody knife what kind of help what means that bloody knife here comes kent to who my lord who hath the office send thy token of reprieve or image of that horror is noble kent your friend very bootless enter a captain he faints my lord my lord look up my lord he is gone indeed we are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards this rascal would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides let all sink with the king and most chirurgeonly very foul sow with none man all idle whores and knaves long live gonzalo we two my lord will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety it is the quality o the climate nor i my spirits are nimble they fell together all as by consent they dropp as by a what might worthy sebastian o what might no more and yet methinks i see it in thy face what thou shouldst be the occasion speaks thee and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head do you not hear me speak noble sebastian thou thy fortune sleep die rather whiles thou art waking i am more serious than my custom you must be so too if heed me which to do trebles thee i teach you how to flow o if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it you more invest it ebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth thus sir although this lord of weak remembrance this who shall be of as little memory when he is earth hath here almost persuaded for he a spirit of persuasion only professes to persuade the king his son alive as impossible that he as he that sleeps here swims o out of that what great hope have you no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even ambition can not pierce a wink beyond but doubt discovery there will you grant with me that ferdinand is drown then tell me who the next heir of naples she that is queen of tunis she that dwells ten leagues beyond man life she that from naples can have no note unless the sun were post the man i the moon too slow till newborn chins be rough and razorable she that from whom we all were though some cast again and by that destiny to perform an act whereof what past is prologue what to come in yours and my discharge a space whose every cubit seems to cry out shall that claribel measure us back to naples keep in tunis and let sebastian wake say this were death that now hath seized them why they were no worse than now they are there be that can rule naples as well as he that sleeps lords that can prate as amply and unnecessarily as this gonzalo i myself could make a chough of as deep chat o that you bore the mind that i do what a sleep were this for your advancement do you understand me and how does your content tender your own good fortune true and look how well my garments sit upon me much feater than before my brother servants were then my fellows now they are my men ay sir where lies that if a kibe put me to my slipper but i feel not this deity in my bosom twenty consciences that stand me and milan candied be they and melt ere they molest here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon if he were that which now he like that dead whom i with this obedient steel three inches of it can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus to the perpetual wink for aye might put this ancient morsel this sir prudence who should not upbraid our course for all the rest they take suggestion as a cat laps milk they tell the clock to any business that we say befits the hour draw together and when i rear my hand do you the like to fall it on gonzalo then let us both be sudden o was a din to fright a monster ear to make an earthquake sure it was the roar of a whole herd of lions i am right glad that he so out of hope do not for one repulse forego the purpose that you resolved to effect let it be for now they are oppress with travel they will not nor can not use such vigilance as when they are fresh i believe both and what does else want credit come to me and i be sworn is true travellers did lie though fools at home condemn i be thy second exeunt seb and ant very like one of them is a plain fish and no doubt marketable i can but say their protestation over so much dear liege i have already sworn that is to live and study here three years but there are other strict observances as not to see a woman in that term which i hope well is not enrolled there and one day in a week to touch no food and but one meal on every day beside the which i hope is not enrolled there and then to sleep but three hours in the night and not be seen to wink of all the day when i was wont to think no harm all night and make a dark night too of half the day which i hope well is not enrolled there o these are barren tasks too hard to keep not to see ladies study fast not sleep let me say no my liege an if you please i only swore to study with your grace and stay here in your court for three years space by yea and nay sir then i swore in jest what is the end of study let me know things hid and barr you mean from common sense come on then i will swear to study so to know the thing i am forbid to know as thus to study where i well may dine when i to feast expressly am forbid or study where to meet some mistress fine when mistresses from common sense are hid or having sworn too hard a keeping oath study to break it and not break my troth if study gain be thus and this be so study knows that which yet it doth not know swear me to this and i will say no why all delights are vain but that most vain which with pain purchased doth inherit pain as painfully to pore upon a book to seek the light of truth while truth the while doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look light seeking light doth light of light beguile so ere you find where light in darkness lies your light grows dark by losing of your eyes study me how to please the eye indeed by fixing it upon a fairer eye who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed and give him light that it was blinded by study is like the heaven glorious sun that will not be with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books these earthly godfathers of heaven lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know nought but fame and every godfather can give a name the spring is near when green geese are fit in his place and time something then in rhyme well say i am why should proud summer boast before the birds have any cause to sing why should i joy in any abortive birth at christmas i no more desire a rose than wish a snow in may mirth but like of each thing that in season grows so you to study now it is too late climb the house to unlock the little gate no my good lord i have sworn to stay with you and though i have for barbarism spoke more than for that angel knowledge you can say yet confident i keep what i have swore and bide the penance of each three years day give me the paper let me read the same and to the decrees i write my name this article my liege yourself must break for well you know here comes in embassy the french king daughter with yourself to speak a maid of grace and complete majesty about surrender up of aquitaine

an old decree we can not cross the cause why we were born therefore of all hands must we be forsworn did they quoth you who sees the heavenly rosaline that like a rude and savage man of inde at the first opening of the gorgeous east bows not his vassal head and strucken blind kisses the base ground with obedient breast what peremptory eye dares look upon the heaven of her brow that is not blinded by her majesty my eyes are then no eyes nor i biron o but for my love day would turn to night of all complexions the cull sovereignty do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek where several worthies make one dignity where nothing wants that want itself doth seek lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues fie painted rhetoric o she needs it not to things of sale a seller praise belongs she passes praise then praise too short doth blot a wither hermit winters worn might shake off fifty looking in her eye beauty doth varnish age as if and gives the crutch the cradle infancy o is the sun that maketh all things shine is ebony like her o wood divine a wife of such wood were felicity o who can give an oath where is a book that i may swear beauty doth beauty lack if that she learn not of her eye to look no face is fair that is not full so black devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light o if in black my lady brows be deck it mourns that painting and usurping hair should ravish doters with a false aspect and therefore is she born to make black fair her favour turns the fashion of the days for native blood is counted painting now and therefore red that would avoid dispraise paints itself black to imitate her brow your mistresses dare never come in rain for fear their colours should be wash away i prove her fair or talk till doomsday here o if the streets were paved with thine eyes her feet were much too dainty for such tread nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn is more than need have at you then affection men at arms consider what you first did swear unto to fast to study and to see no woman flat treason the kingly state of youth say can you fast your stomachs are too young and abstinence engenders maladies and where that you have vow to study lords in that each of you have forsworn his book can you still dream and pore and thereon look for when would you my lord or you or you have found the ground of study excellence without the beauty of a woman face from women eyes this doctrine i derive they are the ground the books the academes from whence doth spring the true promethean fire why universal plodding poisons up the nimble spirits in the arteries as motion and action tires the sinewy vigor of the traveller now for not looking on a woman face you have in that forsworn the use of eyes and study too the causer of your vow for where is any author in the world teaches such beauty as a woman eye learning is but an adjunct to ourself and where we are our learning likewise is then when ourselves we see in ladies eyes do we not likewise see our learning there o we have made a vow to study lords and in that vow we have forsworn our books for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauty tutors have enrich you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil but love first learned in a lady eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lover eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lover ear will hear the lowest sound when the suspicious head of theft is stopp love feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails love tongue proves dainty bacchus gross in taste for valour is not love a hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollo lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were temper with love sighs o then his lines would ravish savage ears and plant in tyrants mild humility from women eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in aught proves excellent then fools you were these women to forswear or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools for wisdom sake a word that all men love or for love sake a word that loves all men or for men sake the authors of these women or women sake by whom we men are men let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths it is religion to be thus forsworn for charity itself fulfils the law and who can sever love from charity advance your standards and upon them lords down with them but be first advised in conflict that you get the sun of them first from the park let us conduct them thither then homeward every man attach the hand of his fair mistress in the afternoon we will with some strange pastime solace them such as the shortness of the time can shape for revels dances masks and merry hours forerun fair love

pleasure must be done this act is as an ancient tale new told and in the last repeating troublesome being urged at a time unseasonable when workmen strive to do better than well they do confound their

thou dost forget thyself enter pandulph what earthly name to interrogatories can task the free breath of a sacred king thou canst not cardinal devise a name so slight unworthy and ridiculous to charge me to an answer as the pope tell him this tale and from the mouth of england add thus much more that no italian priest shall tithe or toll in our dominions but as we under heaven are supreme head so under him that great supremacy where we do reign we will alone uphold without the assistance of a mortal hand so tell the pope all reverence set apart to him and his usurp authority though you and all the kings of christendom are led so grossly by this meddling priest dreading the curse that money may buy out and by the merit of vile gold dross dust purchase corrupted pardon of a man who in that sale sells pardon from himself though you and all the rest so grossly led this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish yet i alone alone do me oppose against the pope and count his friends my foes

heaven hubert i am almost ashamed to say what good respect i have of thee good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet but thou shalt have and creep time so slow yet it shall come for me to do thee good i had a thing to say but let it jo the sun is in the heaven and the proud day attended with the pleasures of the world is all too wanton and too full of gawds to give me audience if the midnight bell did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth sound on into the drowsy race of night if this same were a churchyard where we stand and thou possessed with a thousand wrongs or if that surly spirit melancholy had baked thy blood and made it which else runs tickling up and down the veins making that idiot laughter keep men eyes and strain their cheeks to idle merriment a passion hateful to my purposes or if that thou couldst see me without eyes hear me without thine ears and make reply without a tongue using conceit alone without eyes ears and harmful sound of words then in despite of brooded watchful day i would into thy bosom pour my thoughts but ah i will not yet i love thee well and by my troth i think thou lovest me well do not i know thou wouldst good hubert hubert hubert

attend on you with all true duty on toward calais ho exeunt here once again we sit once again crowned and looked upon i hope with cheerful eyes some reasons of this double coronation i have possess you with and think them strong and more more strong then lesser is my fear i shall indue you with meantime but ask what you would have reform that is not well and well shall you perceive how willingly i will both hear and grant you your request let it be so i do commit his youth to your direction hubert what news with you taking him apart we can not hold mortality strong hand good lords although my will to give is living the suit which you demand is gone and dead he tells us arthur is deceased why do you bend such solemn brows on me think you i bear the shears of destiny have i commandment on the pulse of life they burn in indignation i repent there is no sure foundation set on blood no certain life achieved by others death enter a messenger a fearful eye thou hast where is that blood that i have seen inhabit in those cheeks so foul a sky clears not without a storm pour down thy weather how goes all in france o where hath our intelligence been drunk where hath it slept where is my mother care that such an army could be drawn in france and she not hear of it withhold thy speed dreadful occasion i o make a league with me till i have pleased my discontented peers whati mother deadly how wildly then walks my estate in france under whose conduct came those powers of france that thou for truth givest out are landed here thou hast made me giddy with these ill tidings enter the bastard and peter of pomfret now what says the world to your proceedings do not seek to stuff my head with more ill news for it is full bear with me cousin for i was amazed under the tide but now i breathe again aloft the flood and can give audience to any tongue speak it of what it will thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so hubert away with him imprison him and on that day at noon whereon he says i shall yield up my crown let him be hang deliver him to safety and return for i must use thee exeunt hubert with peter o my gentle cousin thou the news abroad who are arrived gentle kinsman go and thrust thyself into their companies i have a way to win their loves again bring them before me nay but make haste the better foot before o let me have no subject enemies when adverse foreigners affright my towns with dreadful pomp of stout invasion be mercury set feathers to thy heels and fly like thought from them to me again spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman go after him for he perhaps shall need some messenger betwixt me and the peers and be thou he my mother dead hubert five moons why thou to possess me with these fears why urgest thou so oft young arthur death thy hand hath murder him i had a mighty cause to wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humors for a warrant to break within the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humor than advised respect o when the last account heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how oft the sight of means to do ill deeds make deeds ill done hadst not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature mark quoted and signed to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorr aspect finding thee fit for bloody villany apt liable to be employ in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthur death and thou to be endeared to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spake darkly what i purposed or turn an eye of doubt upon my face as bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou didst understand me by my signs and didst in signs again parley with sin yea without stop didst let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshly land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reigns between my conscience and my cousin death doth arthur live o haste thee to the peers throw this report on their incensed rage and make them tame to their obedience forgive the comment that my passion made upon thy feature for my rage was blind and foul imaginary eyes of blood presented thee more hideous than thou art o answer not but to my closet bring the angry lords with all expedient haste i conjure thee but slowly run more fast exeunt thus have i yielded up into your hand the circle of my glory giving the crown now keep your holy word go meet the french and from his holiness use all your power to stop their marches we are inflamed our discontented counties do revolt our people quarrel with obedience swearing allegiance and the love of soul to stranger blood to foreign royalty this inundation of mistemper humor rests by you only to be qualified then pause not for the present time so sick that present medicine must be minister or overthrow incurable ensues is this did not the prophet say that before at noon my crown i should give off even so i have i did suppose it should be on constraint but heaven be thank it is but voluntary enter the bastard would not my lords return to me again after they heard young arthur was alive that villain hubert told me he did live the legate of the pope hath been with me and i have made a happy peace with him and he hath promised to dismiss the powers led by the dauphin have thou the ordering of this present time how goes the day with us o tell me hubert this fever that hath troubled me so long lies heavy on me o my heart is sick enter a messenger tell him toward swinstead to the abbey there ay me this tyrant fever burns me up and will not let me welcome this good news set on toward swinstead to my litter straight weakness possesseth me and i am faint exeunt ay marry now my soul hath it would not out at windows nor at doors there is so hot a summer in my bosom that all my bowels crumble up to dust i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen upon a parchment and against this fire do i shrink up poison ill fare dead forsook cast off and none of you will bid the winter come to thrust his icy fingers in my maw nor let my kingdom rivers take their course through my burn bosom nor entreat the north to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips and comfort me with cold i do not ask you much i beg cold comfort and you are so strait and so ingrateful you deny me that the salt in them is hot within me is a hell and there the poison is as a fiend confined to tyrannize on unreprievable condemned blood enter the bastard o cousin thou art come to set mine eye the tackle of my heart is crack and burn and all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail are turned to one thread one little hair my heart hath one poor string to stay it by which holds but till thy news be uttered and then all this thou seest is but a clod and module of confounded royalty my lord i tell you that self bill is urged which in the eleventh year of the last king reign was like and had indeed against us pass but that the scambling and unquiet time did push it out of farther question it must be thought on if it pass against us we lose the better half of our possession for all the temporal lands which men devout by testament have given to the church would they strip from us being valued thus as much as would maintain to the king honor full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights six thousand and two hundred good esquires and to relief of lazars and weak age of indigent faint souls past corporal toil a hundred almshouses right well supplied and to the coffers of the king beside a thousand pounds of the year thus runs the bill drink the cup and all the king is full of grace and fair regard the courses of his youth promised it not the breath no sooner left his father body but that his wildness mortified in him seem to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whipp the offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise to envelope and contain celestial spirits never was such a sudden scholar made never came reformation in a flood with such a heady currance scouring faults nor never wilfulness so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king hear him but reason in divinity and with an inward wish you would desire the king were made a prelate hear him debate of commonwealth affairs you would say it hath been all in all his study list his discourse of war and you shall hear a fearful battle render you in music turn him to any cause of policy the gordian knot of it he will unloose familiar as his garter that when he speaks the air a charter libertine is still and the mute wonder lurketh in men ears to steal his sweet and honey sentences so that the art and practic part of life must be the mistress to this theoric which is a wonder how his grace should glean it since his addiction was to courses vain his companies unletter rude and shallow his hours fill up with riots banquets sports and never noted in him any study any retirement any sequestration from open haunts and popularity it must be so for miracles are ceased and therefore we must needs admit the means how things are perfected he seems indifferent or rather swaying more upon our part than cherishing the exbibiters against us for i have made an offer to his majesty upon our spiritual convocation and in regard of causes now in hand which i have open to his grace at large as touching france to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessors part withal with good acceptance of his majesty save that there was not time enough to hear as i perceived his grace would fain have done the severals and unhidden passages of his true titles to some certain dukedoms and generally to the crown and seat of france derived from edward his the french ambassador upon that instant craved audience and the hour i think is come to give him hearing is it four then go we in to know his embassy which i could with a ready guess declare before the frenchman speak a word of it god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers that owe yourselves your lives and services to this imperial throne there is no bar to make against your highness claim to france but this which they produce from pharamond terram salicam mulieres ne succedant woman shall succeed in salique land which salique land the french unjustly gloze to be the realm of france and pharamond the founder of this law and female bar yet their own authors faithfully affirm that the land salique is in germany between the floods of sala and of elbe where charles the great having subdued the saxons there left behind and settled certain french who holding in disdain the german women for some dishonest manners of their life establish then this law to wit no female should be inheritrix in salique land which salique as i said elbe and sala is at this day in germany call meisen then doth it well appear that salique law was not devised for the realm of france nor did the french possess the salique land until four hundred one and twenty years after defunction of king pharamond idly supposed the founder of this law who died within the year of our redemption four hundred and charles the great subdued the saxons and did seat the french beyond the river sala in the year eight hundred five besides their writers say king pepin which deposed childeric did as heir general being descended of blithild which was daughter to king clothair make claim and title to the crown of france hugh capet also who usurp the crown of charles the duke of lorraine sole heir male of the true line and stock of charles the great to find his title with some shows of truth though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught convey himself as heir to the lady lingare daughter to charlemain who was the son to lewis the emperor and lewis the son of charles the great also king lewis the tenth who was sole heir to the usurper capet could not keep quiet in his conscience wearing the crown of france till satisfied that fair queen isabel his grandmother was lineal of the lady ermengare daughter to charles the foresaid duke of lorraine by the which marriage the line of charles the great was to the crown of france so that as clear as is the summer sun king pepin title and hugh capet claim king lewis his satisfaction all appear to hold in right and title of the female so do the kings of france unto this day howbeit they would hold up this salique law to bar your highness claiming from the female and rather choose to hide them in a net than amply to imbar their crooked titles usurp from you and your progenitors the sin upon my head dread sovereign for in the book of numbers is it writ when the man dies let the inheritance descend unto the daughter gracious lord stand for you own unwind your bloody flag look back into your mighty ancestors go my dread lord to your tomb from whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit and your edward the black prince who on the french ground play a tragedy making defeat on the full power of france whiles his most mighty father on a hill stood smiling to behold his lion whelp forage in blood of french nobility o noble english that could entertain with half their forces the full pride of france and let another half stand laughing by all out of work and cold for action o let their bodies follow my dear liege with blood and sword and fire to win your right in aid whereof we of the spirituality will raise your highness such a mighty sum as never did the clergy at one time bring in to any of your ancestors they of those marches gracious sovereign shall be a wall sufficient to defend our inland from the pilfering borderers she hath been then more fear than harm my liege for hear her but exampled by herself when all her chivalry hath been in france and she a mourning widow of her nobles she hath herself not only well defended but taken and impounded as a stray the king of scots whom she did send to france to fill king edward fame with prisoner kings and make her chronicle as rich with praise as is the ooze and bottom of the sea with sunken wreck and sunless treasuries therefore doth heaven divide the state of man in divers functions setting endeavour in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or butt obedience for so work the creatures that by a rule in nature teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom they have a king and officers of sorts where some like magistrates correct at home others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers armed in their stings make boot upon the summer velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold the civil citizens kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the justice with his surly hum delivering to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i this infer that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dial centre so may a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat therefore to france my liege divide your happy england into four whereof take you one quarter into france and you withal shall make all gallia shake if we with thrice such powers left at home can not defend our own doors from the dog let us be worried and our nation lose the name of hardiness and policy mi perdonato

of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york and all the clouds that lour upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures war hath smooth his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a lady chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous i that am rudely stamp and want love majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtail of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deform unfinish sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i can not prove a lover to entertain these fair days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mew up about a prophecy which says that g of edward heirs the murderer shall be dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes enter clarence guarded and brakenbury brother good day what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace upon what cause alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers o belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be in the tower but what the matter clarence may i know why this it is when men are ruled by women not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence is she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is deliver we are not safe clarence we are not safe humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty i tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favor with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous widow and herself since that our brother dubb them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in this monarchy even so a please your worship brakenbury you may partake of any thing we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shore wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queen kindred are made gentlefolks how say you sir can you deny all this naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best he do it secretly alone her husband knave wouldst thou betray me we are the queen abjects and must obey brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoever you will employ me in were it to call king edward widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine well your imprisonment shall not be long i will deliver you or else lie for you meantime have patience go tread the path that thou shalt return simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands but who comes here the hastings enter lord hastings as much unto my good lord chamberlain well are you welcome to the open air how hath your lordship brook imprisonment no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevail as much on him as you what news abroad now by saint paul this news is bad indeed o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumed his royal person very grievous to be thought upon what is he in his bed go you before and i will follow you exit hastings he can not live i hope and must not die till george be pack with up to heaven i in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steel with weighty arguments and if i fail not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then i marry warwick youngest daughter what though i kill her husband and her father the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto but yet i run before my horse to market clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains exit stay you that bear the corse and set it down villains set down the corse or by saint paul i make a corse of him that disobeys unmanner dog stand thou when i command advance thy halberd higher than my breast or by saint paul i strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness sweet saint for charity be not so curst lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses but i know none and therefore am no beast more wonderful when angels are so angry vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these supposed evils to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself by such despair i should accuse myself say that i slew them not i did not kill your husband nay he is dead and slain by edward hand i was provoked by her slanderous tongue which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders i grant ye the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth yes one place else if you will hear me name it your so will it madam till i lie with you i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall somewhat into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner your beauty was the cause of that effect your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom these eyes could never endure sweet beauty wreck you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheered by the sun so i by that it is my day my life curse not thyself fair creature thou art both it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth you he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband he lives that loves thee better than he could plantagenet the selfsame name but one of better nature here she spitteth at him why dost thou spit at me never came poison from so sweet a place thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspect with store of childish drops these eyes which never shed remorseful tear no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my father death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the had wet their cheeks like trees bedash with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing words but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak she looks scornfully at him teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart can not forgive lo here i lend thee this sword which if thou please to hide in this true bosom and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword nay do not pause for i did kill king henry but was thy beauty that provoked me nay now dispatch was i that stabb young edward but was thy heavenly face that set me on here she lets fall the sword take up the sword again or take up me then bid me kill myself and i will do it tush that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word that hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary is figured in my tongue then never man was true say then my peace is made but shall i live in hope vouchsafe to wear this ring look how this ring encompasseth thy finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine and if thy poor devoted suppliant may but beg one favor at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness for ever that it would please thee leave these sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby place where after i have solemnly at chertsey monastery this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon bid me farewell sirs take up the corse no to there attend my coming exeunt all but gloucester was ever woman in this humor woo was ever woman in this humor won i have her but i will not keep her long what i that kill her husband and his father to take her in her heart extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of her hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i nothing to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing ha hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabb in my angry mood at tewksbury a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framed in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world can not again afford and will she yet debase her eyes on me that cropp the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woful bed on me whose all not equals edward moiety on me that halt and am unshapen thus my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while upon my life she finds although i can not myself to be a marvellous proper man i be at charges for a and entertain some score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body since i am crept in favor with myself i will maintain it with some little cost but first i turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass exit they do me wrong and i will not endure it who are they that complain unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors because i can not flatter and speak fair smile in men faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy can not a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abused by silken sly insinuating jacks to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace when have i injured thee when done thee wrong or thee or thee or any of your faction a plague upon you all his royal person whom god preserve better than you would wish can not be quiet scarce a but you must trouble him with lewd complaints i can not tell the world is grown so bad that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch since every jack became a gentleman there many a gentle person made a jack meantime god grants that we have need of you our brother is imprison by your means myself disgraced and the nobility held in contempt whilst many fair promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble you may deny that you were not the cause of my lord hastings late imprisonment she may lord rivers why who knows not so she may do more sir than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honors on your high deserts what may she not she may yea marry may she what marry may she marry with a king a bachelor a handsome stripling too i wis your grandam had a worser match what threat you me with telling of the king tell him and spare not look what i have said i will avouch in presence of the king i dare adventure to be sent to the tower is time to speak my pains are quite forgot ere you were queen yea or your husband king i was a in his great affairs a of his proud adversaries a liberal rewarder of his friends to royalise his blood i spilt mine own in all which time

have been ere now and what you are withal what i have been and what i am poor clarence did forsake his father warwick yea and forswore himself which jesu pardon to fight on edward party for the crown and for his meed poor lord he is mew up i would to god my heart were flint like edward or edward soft and pitiful like mine i am too for this world if i should be i had rather be a pedlar far be it from my heart the thought of it foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight wert thou not banished on pain of death the curse my noble father laid on thee when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns rivers from his eyes and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout steep in the faultless blood of pretty rutland his curses then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee are all fall n upon thee and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed have done thy charm thou hateful wither hag margaret ha i cry thee mercy then for i had thought that thou hadst call me all these bitter names is done by me and ends in good counsel marry learn it learn it marquess yea and much more but i was born so high our aery buildeth in the cedar top and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun what doth she say my lord of buckingham i can not blame her by god holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her but you have all the vantage of her wrong i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is frank up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause of it so do i ever aside being well advised for had i cursed now i had cursed myself enter catesby i do the wrong and first begin to brawl the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to hastings derby buckingham and say it is the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother now they believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villany with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil enter two murderers but soft here come my executioners how now my hardy stout resolved mates are you now going to dispatch this deed well thought upon i have it here about me gives the warrant when you have done repair to crosby place but sirs be sudden in the execution withal

they all start you do him injury to scorn his corse but he poor soul by your first order died and that a winged mercury did bear some tardy cripple bore the countermand that came too lag to see him buried god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion enter derby this is the fruit of rashness mark you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen look pale when they did hear of clarence death o they did urge it still unto the king god will revenge it but come let us in to comfort edward with our company madam have comfort all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star but none can cure their harms by wailing them madam my mother i do cry you mercy i did

his head man somewhat we will do and look when i am king claim thou of me the earldom of hereford and the moveables whereof the king my brother stood possess and look to have it yielded with all willingness come let us sup betimes that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form exeunt my noble lords and cousins all good morrow i have been long a sleeper but i hope my absence doth neglect no great designs which by my presence might have been concluded than my lord hastings no man might be bolder his lordship knows me well and loves me well my lord of ely when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them cousin of buckingham a word with you drawing him aside catesby hath sounded hastings in our business and finds the testy gentleman so hot as he will lose his head ere give consent his master son as worshipful he terms it shall lose the royalty of england throne i pray you all tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damned witchcraft and that have upon my body with their hellish charms then be your eyes the witness of this ill see how i am bewitch behold mine arm is like a blasted sapling wither up and this is edward wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have marked me if thou protector of this damned strumpet tellest thou me of thou art a traitor off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same lovel and ratcliff look that it be done the rest that love me rise and follow me exeunt all but hastings ratcliff and lovel come cousin canst thou quake and change thy color murder thy breath in middle of a word and then begin again and stop again as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror he is and see he brings the mayor along enter the mayor and catesby look to the drawbridge there catesby the walls look back defend thee here are enemies be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel enter lovel and ratcliff with hastings head so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon this earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daub his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted i mean his conversation with shore wife he lived from all attainder of suspect what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly to the villain death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons safety enforced us to this execution yet had not we determined he should die until your lordship came to see his death which now the loving haste of these our friends somewhat against our meaning have prevented because my lord we would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treason that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconstrue us in him and wail his death and to that end we wish your lordship here to avoid the carping censures of the world go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edward children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termed so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched to their servants daughters wives even where his lustful eye or savage heart without control listed to make his prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that unsatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by just computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father but touch this sparingly as far off because you know my lord my mother lives if you thrive well bring them to baynard castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and bishops go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw to cate go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynard castle exeunt all but gloucester now will i in to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give notice that no manner of person at any time have recourse unto the princes exit how now my lord what say the citizens touch you the bastardy of edward children ah and did they so what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak will not the mayor then and his brethren come i go and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt we bring it to a happy issue my lord there needs no such apology i rather do beseech you pardon me who earnest in the service of my god neglect the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your grace pleasure i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the city eyes and that you come to reprehend my ignorance else wherefore breathe i in a christian land i know not whether to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so season with your faithful love to me then on the other side i check my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects as i had rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapor of my glory smother but god be thanked there no need of me and much i need to help you if need were the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellow by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay what you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him alas why would you heap these cares on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i can not nor i will not yield to you o do not swear my lord of buckingham exit buckingham with the citizens would you enforce me to a world of care well call them again i am not made of stone but penetrable to your kind entreats albeit against my conscience and my soul buckingham and the rest cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burthen whether i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god he knows and you may partly see how far i am from the desire thereof in saying so you shall but say the truth even when you please since you will have it so come let us to our holy task again farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends exeunt stand all apart cousin of buckingham give me thy hand here he ascendeth his throne thus high by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated but shall we wear these honors for a day or shall they last and we rejoice in them o buckingham now do i play the touch to try if thou be current gold indeed young edward lives think now what i would say why buckingham i say i would be king ha am i king is so but edward lives o bitter consequence that edward still should live noble prince cousin thou wert not wont to be so dull shall i be plain i wish the bastards dead and i would have it suddenly perform what sayest thou speak suddenly be brief tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezeth say have i thy consent that they shall die i will converse with fools and unrespective boys none are for me that look into me with considerate eyes buckingham grows circumspect boy thou not any whom corrupting gold would tempt unto a close exploit of death what is his name i partly know the man go call him hither exit page the witty buckingham no more shall be the neighbor to my counsel hath he so long held out with me untired and stops he now for breath enter stanley how now what news with you catesby rumor it abroad that anne my wife is sick and like to die i will take order for her keeping close inquire me out some gentleman whom i will marry straight to clarence daughter the boy is foolish and i fear not him look how thou i say again give out that anne my wife is sick and like to die about it for it stands me much upon to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me exit catesby i must be married to my brother daughter or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass murder her brothers and then marry her uncertain way of gain but i am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin pity dwells not in this eye page with tyrrel is thy name tyrrel art thou indeed darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine why there thou hast it two deep enemies foes to my rest and my sweet sleep disturbers are they that i would have thee deal upon tyrrel i mean those bastards in the tower thou sweet music hark come hither tyrrel go by this token rise and lend thine ear whispers there is no more but so say it is done and i will love thee and prefer thee too shall we hear from thee tyrrel ere we sleep well let that pass dorset is fled to richmond stanley he is your wife son well look to it stanley look to your wife if she convey letters to richmond you shall answer it as i remember henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king when richmond was a little peevish boy a king perhaps perhaps how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me i being by that i should kill him richmond when last i was at exeter the mayor in courtesy show me the castle and call it rougemont at which name i started because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond ay what well but what well let it strike because that like a jack thou the stroke betwixt thy begging and my meditation i am not in the giving vein tut

this unhair sauciness and boyish troops the king doth smile at and is well prepared to whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms from out the circle of his territories that hand which had the strength even at your door to cudgel you and make you take the hatch to dive like buckets in concealed wells to crouch in litter of your stable planks to lie like pawns lock up in chests and trunks to hug with swine to seek sweet safety out in vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake even at the crying of your nation crow thinking his voice an armed englishman shall that victorious hand be feebled here that in your chambers gave you chastisement no know the gallant monarch is in arms and like an eagle his aery towers to souse annoyance that comes near his nest and you degenerate you ingrate revolts

motion and spleen of speed to see your majesty the dauphin is preparing hitherward where heaven he knows how we shall answer him for in a night the best part of my power as i upon advantage did remove were in the washes all unwarily devoured by the unexpected flood the king dies art thou gone so i do but stay behind to do the office for thee of revenge and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven as it on earth hath been thy servant still now now you stars that move in your right spheres where be your powers show now your mended faiths and instantly return with me again to push destruction and perpetual shame out of the weak door of our fainting land straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought the dauphin rages at our very heels he will the rather do it when he sees ourselves well sinewed to our defence let it be so and you my noble prince with other princes that may best be spared shall wait upon your father funeral thither shall it then and happily may your sweet self put on the lineal state and glory of the land to whom with all submission on my knee i do bequeath my faithful services and true subjection everlastingly o let us pay the time but needful woe since it hath been beforehand with our griefs this england never did nor never shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror but when it first did help to wound itself now these her princes are come home again come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true exeunt though no man lesser fears the greeks than i as far as toucheth my particular yet dread priam there is no lady of more softer bowels more spongy to suck in the sense of fear more ready to cry out knows what follows than hector is the wound of peace is surety surety secure but modest doubt is the beacon of the wise the tent that searches to the bottom of the worst let helen go since the first sword was drawn about this question every tithe soul many thousand dismes hath been as dear as helen i mean of ours if we have lost so many tenths of ours to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us had it our name the value of one ten what merit in that reason which denies the yielding of her up brother she is not worth what she doth costthe holding but value dwells not in particular will it holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein is precious of itself as in the prizer is mad idolatry to make the service greater than the god and the will dotes that is attributive to what infectiously itself affects without some image of the affected merit it is cassandra enter cassandra raving peace sister peace now youthful troilus do not these high strains of divination in our sister work some touches of remorse or is your blood so madly hot that no discourse of reason nor fear of bad success in a bad cause can qualify the same paris and troilus you have both said well and on the cause and question now in hand have glozed but superficially not much unlike young men whom aristotle thought unfit to hear moral philosophy the reasons you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distemper blood than to make up a free determination right and wrong for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision nature craves all dues be render to their owners now what nearer debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband if this law of nature be corrupted through affection and that great minds of partial indulgence to their benumbed wills resist the same there is a law in each nation to curb those raging appetites that are most disobedient and refractory if helen then be wife to sparta king as it is known she is these moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back return thus to

it harrows me with fear and wonder what art thou that this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak stay speak speak i charge thee speak exit ghost before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he the ambitious norway combated so frown he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice is strange in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick on by a most emulate pride dared to the combat in which our valiant for so this side of our known world esteem did slay this fortinbras who by a seal compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seized of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant and carriage of the article design his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach i which is no as it doth well appear unto our but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this and romage in the land a mote it is to trouble the mind eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and but soft behold lo where it comes again ghost i cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me cock crows if thou art privy to thy country fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak stop it marcellus do if it will not stand is here and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty hail to your lordship the same my lord and your poor servant ever a truant disposition good my lord my lord i came to see your father funeral indeed my lord it follow hard upon where my lord i saw him once he was a goodly king my lord i think i saw him yesternight my lord the king your father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and bernado on their watch in the dead vast and middle of the night been thus encounter a figure like your father armed at point exactly appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he by their oppress and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon length whilst they almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up its head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish from our sight as i do live my honor lord is true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it o yes my lord he wore his beaver up a countenance more in sorrow than in anger nay very pale most constantly it would have much amazed you while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred not when i saw it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver i warrant it will it is a nipping and an eager air i think it lacks of twelve indeed i heard it not then it draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord is it a custom look my lord it comes enter ghost it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone no by no means do not my lord what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath be ruled you shall not go he waxes desperate with imagination have after to what issue will this come heaven will direct it heaven secure him hillo ho ho my lord what news my lord good my lord tell it not i my lord by heaven there needs no ghost my lord come from the grave to tell us this these are but wild and whirling words my lord there no offence my lord what my lord we will in faith my lord not i propose the oath my lord o day and night but this is wondrous strange o my dear lord well my lord if he steal aught the whilst this play is playing and detecting i will pay the theft good she were spoken with for she may strew dangerous conjectures in minds what are they that would speak with me let them come in exit servant i do not know from what part of the world i should be greeted if not from lord hamlet enter sailors good my lord be quiet the attendants part them and they come out of the grave remember it my lord that is most certain possible i beseech you ay good my lord how was this seal so guildenstern and rosencrantz go why what a king is this it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there peace who comes here enter osric they bleed on both sides how is it my lord never believe it i am more an antique roman than a dane here yet some liquor left now cracks a noble heart good night sweet prince and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest why does the drum come hither march within enter fortinbras the english ambassadors and others what is it ye would see if aught of woe or wonder cease your search not from his mouth had it the ability of life to thank you he never gave commandment for their death but since so jump upon this bloody question you from the polack wars and you from england are here arrived give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about so shall you hear of carnal bloody and unnatural acts of accidental judgements casual slaughters of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause and in this upshot purposes mistook fall n on the inventor heads all this can i truly deliver of that i shall have also cause to speak and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more but let this same be presently perform even while men minds are wild lest more mischance on plots and errors happen is it not yours what ever have been thought on in this state that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention is not four days gone since i heard thence these are the words i think i have the letter here yes here it is reads have press a power but it is not known whether for east or west the dearth is great the people mutinous and it is rumour cominius marcius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither is bent most likely is for you consider of it nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veil till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seem appeared to rome by the discovery we shall be shorten in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot o doubt not that i speak from certainties nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward i leave your honours if we and caius marcius chance to meet sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more and keep your honours safe we hate alike not afric owns a serpent i abhor more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot if i fly marcius holloa me like a hare wert thou the hector that was the whip of your bragg progeny thou shouldst not scape me here they fight and certain volsces come in the aid of aufidius marcius fights till they be driven in breathless officious and not valiant you have shamed me in your condemned seconds exeunt the town is condition i would i were a roman for i can not being a volsce be that i am condition what good condition can a treaty find i the part that is at mercy five times marcius i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me and wouldst do so i think should we encounter as often as we eat by the elements if again i meet him beard to beard he mine or i am his mine emulation hath not that honour i it had for where i thought to crush him in an equal force true sword to sword i potch at him some way or wrath or craft may get him bolder though not so subtle my valour with only suffering stain by him for him shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary being naked sick nor fane nor capitol the prayers of priests nor time of sacrifice embarquements all of fury shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom my hate to marcius where i find him were it at home upon my brother guard even there against the hospitable canon would i wash my fierce hand in heart go you to the city learn how is held and what they are that must be hostages for rome i am attended at the cypress grove i pray south the city me word thither how the world goes that to the pace of it i may spur on my journey where is this fellow whence comest thou what wouldst thou thy name why not speak man what thy name what is thy name say what thy name thou hast a grim appearance and thy face bears a command i though thy tackle torn thou a noble vessel what thy name i know thee not thy name o marcius marcius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say tis true not believe them more than thee all noble marcius let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarr the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour know thou first i loved the maid i married never man sigh truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each other throat and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius had we no quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banish we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood o come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepared against your territories though not for rome itself therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenge take the one half of my commission and set as best thou art experienced since thou thy country strength and weakness own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes and more a friend than an enemy yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome exeunt coriolanus and aufidius the two servingmen come forward do they still fly to the roman i can not help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in that no changeling and i must excuse what can not be amended i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine we come to our account all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence i think he be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honours even whether was pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgement to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controll the war but one of as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free him fear so hated and so banish but he has a merit to choke it in the utterance so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a chair to extol what it hath done one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail come let away when caius rome is thine thou art of all then shortly art thou mine exeunt you keep a constant temper exeunt coriolanus and aufidius only their ends you have respected stopp your ears against the general suit of rome never admitted a private whisper no not with such friends that thought them sure of you i was moved withal i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour at difference in thee out of that i work myself a former fortune the ladies make signs to coriolanus go tell the lords o the city i am here deliver them this paper having read it bid them repair to the where i even in theirs and in the commons ears will vouch the truth of it him i accuse the city ports by this hath enter and intends to appear before the people hoping to purge himself with words dispatch exeunt attendants enter three or four conspirators of aufidius faction most welcome even so as with a man by his own alms empoison and with his charity slain sir i can not tell we must proceed as we do find the people i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction i raised him and i mine honour for his truth who being so heighten he water his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends and to this end he bow his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free that i would have spoke of being banish for he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat i took him made him with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men served his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong till at the last i seem his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary there was it for which my sinews shall be stretch upon him at a few drops of women rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour of our great action therefore shall he die and i renew me in his fall but hark drums and trumpets sound with great shouts of the people say no more here come the lords enter the lords of the city i have not deserved it but worthy lords have you with heed perused what i have written to you he approaches you shall hear him enter coriolanus marching with drum and colours commoners being with him read it not noble lords but tell the traitor in the degree he hath abused your powers ay traitor marcius ay marcius caius marcius dost thou think i grace thee with that robbery thy stol n name coriolanus in corioli you lords and heads o the state perfidiously he has betray your business and given up for certain drops of salt your city rome i say city to his wife and mother breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk never admitting counsel o the war but at his nurse tears he whined and roar away your victory that pages blush at him and men of heart look wondering each at other name not the god thou boy of tears no more why noble lords will you be put in mind of his blind fortune which was your shame by this unholy braggart your own eyes and ears insolent villain my noble masters hear me speak my lords when you shall in this rage provoked by him you can not great danger which this man life did owe you you rejoice that he is thus cut off please it your honours to call me to your senate i deliver myself your loyal servant or endure your heaviest censure my rage is gone and i am struck with sorrow take him up help three o the chiefest soldiers i be one beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully trail your steel pikes though in this city he hath widow and unchilded many a one which to this hour bewail the injury yet he shall have a noble memory assist exeunt bearing the body of coriolanus a dead march sounded in sooth i know not why i am so sad it wearies me you say it wearies you but how i caught it found it or came by it what stuff is made of whereof it is born i am to learn and such a sadness makes of me that i have much ado to know myself believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad fie fie your worth is very dear in my regard i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace the occasion to depart i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one farewell i grow a talker for this gear is that any thing now well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you promised to tell me of i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honor be assured my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlock to your occasions you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak thou that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rack even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake exeunt shylock although i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend i break a custom is he yet how much ye would and for three months i do never use it and what of him did he take interest this was a venture sir that jacob served for a thing not in his power to bring to pass but sway and fashion by the hand of heaven was this inserted to make interest good or is your gold and silver ewes and rams mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o what a goodly outside falsehood hath well shylock shall we be beholding to you i am as like to call thee so again to spit on

what trojan is that same that looks so heavy the youngest son of priam a true knight not yet mature yet matchless firm of word speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm his heart and hand both open and both free for what he has he gives what thinks he shows yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty nor dignifies an impair thought with breath manly as hector but more dangerous for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love they call him troilus and on him erect a second hope as fairly built as hector thus says aeneas one that knows the youth even to his inches and with private soul did in great ilion thus translate him to me alarum hector and ajax fight they are in action his blows are well disposed there ajax worthy of arms as welcome as to one that would be rid of such an enemy but that no welcome understand more clear what past and what to come is

sports are tasking of their minds and at the deanery where a priest attends straight marry her to this her mother plot she seemingly obedient likewise hath made promise to the doctor now thus it rests her father means she shall be all in white and in that habit when slender sees his time to take her by the hand and bid her go she shall go with him her mother hath intended the better to denote her to the doctor for they must all be mask and vizarded that quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed with ribands pendent flaring her head and when the doctor spies his vantage ripe to pinch her by the hand and on that token the maid hath given consent to go with him both my good host to go along with me and here it rests that you procure the vicar to stay for me at church twelve and one and in the lawful name of marrying to give our hearts united ceremony so shall i evermore be bound to thee besides i make a present recompense exeunt you do amaze hear the truth of it you would have married her most shamefully where there was no proportion held in love the truth is she and i long since contracted are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us the offence is holy that she hath committed and this deceit loses the name of craft of disobedience or unduteous title since therein she doth evitate and shun a thousand irreligious cursed hours which forced marriage would have brought upon her
