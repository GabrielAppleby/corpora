0,tgv-5,JULIA,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-5," But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?

 Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
That every day with parle encounter me,
In thy opinion which is worthiest love?

 What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?

 What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?

 What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?

 How now! what means this passion
at his name?

 Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?

 Your reason?

 And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?

 Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.

 His little speaking shows his love but small.

 They do not love that do not show their love.

 I would I knew his mind.

 'To Julia.' Say, from whom?

 Say, say, who gave it thee?

 Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines?
To whisper and conspire against my youth?
Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
And you an officer fit for the place.
There, take the paper: see it be return'd;
Or else return no more into my sight.

 Will ye be gone?

 And yet I would I had overlooked the letter:
It were a shame to call her back again
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
And would not force the letter to my view!
Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
When willingly I would have had her here!
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
My penance is to call Lucetta back
And ask remission for my folly past.
What ho! Lucetta!
Re-enter LUCETTA.
 Is't near dinner-time?

 What is't that you took up so gingerly?

 Why didst thou stoop, then?

 And is that paper nothing?

 Then let it lie for those that it concerns.

 Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.

 As little by such toys as may be possible.
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'

 Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?

 And why not you?

 Let's see your song. How now, minion!

 You do not?

 You, minion, are too saucy.

 The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.

 This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
Here is a coil with protestation!
                   [Tears the letter.
Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
You would be fingering them, to anger me.

 Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd;
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
Till I have found each letter in the letter,
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
And throw it thence into the raging sea!
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
And yet I will not, sith so prettily
He couples it to his complaining names.
Thus will I fold them one upon another:
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.

Re-enter LUCETTA.
 Well, let us go.

 If you respect them, best to take them up.

 I see you have a month's mind to them.

 Come, come; will't please you go?
                   [Exeunt. I must, where is no remedy.

 If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
                                  [Giving a ring.
 And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.

 Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
Are visibly character'd and engraved,
To lesson me and tell me some good mean
How, with my honour, I may undertake
A journey to my loving Proteus.

 A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
And when the flight is made to one so dear,
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.

 O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
By longing for that food so long a time.
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.

 The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
The current that with gentle murmur glides,
Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
But when his fair course is not hindered,
He makes sweet music with the enamell'd stones,
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
And so by many winding nooks he strays
With willing sport to the wild ocean.
Then let me go and hinder not my course:
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
And make a pastime of each weary step,
Till the last step have brought me to my love;
And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.

 Not like a woman; for I would prevent
The loose encounters of lascivious men:
Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
As may beseem some well-reputed page.

 No, girl; I'll knit it up in silken strings
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
To be fantastic may become a youth
Of greater time than I shall show to be.

 That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.

 Out, out, Lucetta! that will be ill-favor'd.

 Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
I fear me, it will make me scandalized.

 Nay, that I will not.

 That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
And instances of infinite of love
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.

 Base men, that use them to so base effect!
But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth;
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.

 Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
Only deserve my love by loving him;
And presently go with me to my chamber,
To take a note of what I stand in need of,
To furnish me upon my longing journey.
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
My goods, my lands, my reputation;
Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
Come, answer not, but to it presently!
I am impatient of my tarriance.
[Exeunt. 
           I would always have one play but one thing.
But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?

  Peace! stand aside: the company parts.

 'Twere false, if I should speak it;
For I am sure she is not buried.

 He heard not that.

 If 'twere a substance, you would, sure, deceive it,
And make it but a shadow, as I am.

   Not so; but it hath been the longest night
That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.
[Exeunt.
 In what you please: I'll do what I can.

 It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
She is dead, belike?

 Alas!

 I cannot choose
But pity her.

 Because methinks that she loved you as well
As you do love your lady Silvia:
She dreams on him that has forgot her love;
You dote on her that cares not for your love.
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
And thinking on it makes me cry 'alas!'

 How many women would do such a message?
Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
That with his very heart despiseth me?
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
Because I love him, I must pity him.
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
To bind him to remember my good will;
And now am I, unhappy messenger,
To plead for that which I would not obtain,
To carry that which I would have refused,
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
I am my master's true-confirmed love;
But cannot be true servant to my master,
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
Enter SILVIA, attended.
Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.

 If you be she, I do entreat your patience
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.

 From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.

 Ay, madam.

 Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
This is the letter to your ladyship.

 It may not be; good madam, pardon me.

 Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.

 She thanks you.

 I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.

 Almost as well as I do know myself:
To think upon her woes I do protest
That I have wept a hundred several times.

 I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
    She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
When she did think my master loved her well,
She, in my judgement, was as fair as you;
But since she did neglect her looking-glass
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
That now she is become as black as I.

 About my stature; for at Pentecost,
When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
Which served me as fit, by all men's judgements,
As if the garment had been made for me:
Therefore I know she is about my height.
And at that time I made her weep agood,
For I did play a lamentable part:
Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
Which I so lively acted with my tears
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!

 And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
Since she respects my mistress' love so much,
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
Here is her picture; let me see; I think,
If I had such a tire, this face of mine
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
Unless I flatter with myself too much.
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
If that be all the difference in his love,
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
Ay, but her forehead 's low, and mine's as high,
What should it be that he respects in her
But I can make respective in myself,
If this fond love were not a blinded god?
Come, shadow, come, and take this shadow up,
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
And, were there sense in his idolatry,
My substance should be statue in thy stead.
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes,
To make my master out of love with thee!

Exit.
 But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.

 'Tis true; such pearls as put out ladies' eyes;
For I had rather wink than look on them.

 But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.

 She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.

 True; from a gentleman to a fool.

 That such an ass should owe them.

 Here comes the duke.
Enter DUKE.
 And I will follow, more to cross that love
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
[Exit.
 And me, when he approacheth to your presence.

   Here 'tis; this is it.

 O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.

 And Julia herself did give it me;
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.

 Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
In a disguise of love:
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.

 And I mine.
Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO.
"
1,tgv-8,SILVIA,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-8," Sir Valentine and servant, to you
two thousand.
    I thank you, gentle servant: 'tis very
clerkly done.

 Perchance you think too much of so
much pains?

 A pretty period!   Well, I guess the sequel;
And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
    Yes, yes: the lines are very quaintly writ;
But since unwillingly, take them again.
Nay, take them.

 Ay, ay: you writ them sir, at my request;
But I will none of them; they are for you;
I would have had them writ more movingly.

 And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.

  Why, if it please you, take it for your labor:
And so, good morrow, servant. Exit.
       Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
Upon some other pawn for fealty.

 Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind,
How could he see his way to seek out you?

 Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
[Exit THURIO.
Enter PROTEUS
 His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.

 Too low a mistress for so high a servant.

 And duty never yet did want his meed:
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.

 That you are welcome?

 I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
When you have done, we look to hear from you.

 I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
Who is that that spake?

 Sir Proteus, as I take it.

 What's your will?

 You have your wish; my will is even this:
That presently you hie you home to bed.
Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
To be seduced by thy flattery,
That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
Return, return and make thy love amends.
For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
I am so far from granting thy request
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
And by and by intend to chide myself
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.

 Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,
I am bethroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
To wrong him with thy importunacy?

 And so suppose am I; for in his grave
Assure thyself my love is buried.

 Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence.
Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
   I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
But since your falsehood shall become you well
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
And so, good rest.

 Who calls?

 Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.

 O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd,
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine
Nor how my father would enforce me marry
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say
No grief did ever come so near thy heart
As when thy lady and thy true love died,
Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
I do desire thy worthy company,
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
And on the justice of my flying hence,
To keep me from a most unholy match,
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
I do desire thee, even from a heart
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
To bear me company and go with me:
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
That I may venture to depart alone.

 This evening coming.

 At Friar Patrick's cell,
Where I intend holy confession.

 Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.            [Exeunt severally.
 What would you with her, if that I be she?

 From whom?

 O, he sends you for a picture.

 Ursula, bring my picture there.
Go give your master this: tell him from me,
One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.

 I pray thee, let me look on that again.

 There, hold!
I will not look upon your master's lines:
I know they are stuff'd with protestations
And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
As easily as I do tear his paper.

 The more shame for him that he sends it me;
For I have heard him say a thousand times
His Julia gave it him at his departure.
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.

 What say'st thou?

 Dost thou know her?

 Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.

 Is she not passing fair?

 How tall was she?

 She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
I weep myself to think upon thy words.
Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
Farewell.

[Exit Silvia, with attendants.
 Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
I fear I am attended by some spies.

 A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.

 O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
                                      [Exeunt.
 O miserable, unhappy that I am!

 By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.

 Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
And full as much, for more there cannot be,
I do detest false perjured Proteus.
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.

 When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths.
Descended into perjury, to love me.
Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
And that's far worse than none; better have none
Than plural faith which is too much by one:
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!

 All men but Proteus.

 O heaven!

"
2,tgv-6,LUCETTA,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-6," Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.

 Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
According to my shallow simple skill.

 As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
But, were I you, he never should be mine.

 Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.

 Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!

 Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
That I, unworthy body as I am,
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.

 Then thus: of many good I think him best.

 I have no other but a woman's reason;
I think him so because I think him so.

 Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.

 Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.

 Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.

 O, they love least that let men know their love.

 Peruse this paper, madam.

 That the contents will show.

 Sir Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
Did in your name receive it: pardon the fault I pray.

 To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.

 That you may ruminate. [Exit.
 What would your ladyship?

 I would it were,
That you might kill your stomach on your meat
And not upon your maid.

 Nothing.

 To take a paper up that I let fall.

 Nothing concerning me.

 Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,
Unless it have a false interpreter.

 That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
Give me a note: your ladyship can set.

 It is too heavy for so light a tune.

 Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.

 I cannot reach so high.

 Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.

 No, madam; it is too sharp.

 Nay, now you are too flat
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.

 Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.

 She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
To be so anger'd with another letter. [Exit.
 Madam,
Dinner is ready, and your father stays.

 What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?

 Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.

 Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
I see things too, although you judge I wink.

 Alas, the way is wearisome and long!

 Better forbear till Proteus make return.

 I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.

 But in what habit will you go along?

 Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.

 What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?

 You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.

 A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.

 If you think so, then stay at home and go not.

 Then never dream on infamy, but go.
If Proteus like your journey when you come,
No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.

 All these are servants to deceitful men.

 Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!

"
3,por.,PORTIA,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-por.,"                In terms of choice I am not solely led
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
Besides, the lottery of my destiny
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
But if my father had not scanted me
And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
His wife who wins me by that means I told you
Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
As any comer I have look'd on yet
For my affection.

 You must take your chance,
And either not attempt to choose at all
Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.

 First, forward to the temple: after dinner
Your hazard shall be made.

 Go draw aside the curtains and discover
The several caskets to this noble prince.
Now make your choice.

 The one of them contains my picture, prince:
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

 There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
Then I am yours.
[He unlocks the golden casket.
 A gentle riddance.   Draw the curtains, go.
Let all of his complexion choose me so.
[Exeunt.
 Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
You must be gone from hence immediately.

 To these injunctions every one doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.

 Too long a pause for that which you find there.

 To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
And of opposed natures.

 Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

 Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
Enter a Servant.
 Here: what would my lord?

 No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.

 I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
I lose your company: therefore forbear a while.
There's something tells me, but it is not love,
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
Hate counsels not in such a quality.
But lest you should not understand me well,--
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
I would detain you here some month or two
Before you venture for me. I could teach you
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
So will I never be: so may you miss me;
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
That I had been forsworn.   Beshrew your eyes,
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
And so all yours. O, these naughty times
Put bars between the owners and their rights!
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
To eke it and to draw it out in length,
To stay you from election.

 Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
What treason there is mingled with your love.

 Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
Where men enforced do speak anything.

 Well then, confess and live.

 Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
If you do love me, you will find me out.
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
Fading in music: that the comparison
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
And watery death-bed for him.   He may win;
And what is music then?   Then music is
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
To a new-crowned monarch; such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
With no less presence, but with much more love,
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice;
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
With bleared visages, come forth to view
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself.
SONG.
Tell me where is fancy bred,
Or in the heart, or in the head?
How begot, how nourished?
Reply, reply.
It is engender'd in the eyes,
With gazing fed; and fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring fancy's knell:
I'll begin it--Ding, dong, bell.

 [Aside] How all the other passions fleet to air,
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy!
O love,
Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
For fear I surfeit.

 You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
Such as I am: though for myself alone
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
To wish myself much better; yet, for you
I would be trebled twenty times myself;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times
More rich;
That only to stand high in your account,
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
Exceed account; but the full sum of me
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
Happy in this, she is not yet so old
But she may learn; happier than this,
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed,
As from her lord, her governor, her king.
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted: but now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
This house, these servants and this same myself
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
Let it presage the ruin of your love
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

 Is this true, Nerissa?

 So do I, my lord:
They are entirely welcome.

 There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
That steals the color from Bassanio's cheek:
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
Could turn so much the constitution
Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
With leave, Bassanio; I am half yourself,
And I must freely have the half of anything
That this same paper brings you.

 Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

 What sum owes he the Jew?

 What, no more?
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
Double six thousand, and then treble that,
Before a friend of this description
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife,
And then away to Venice to your friend;
For never shall you lie by Portia's side
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.

 O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!

 I never did repent for doing good,
Nor shall not now: for in companions
That do converse and waste the time together,
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
Which makes me think that this Antonio,
Being the bosom lover of my lord,
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
How little is the cost I have bestow'd
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish misery!
This comes too near the praising of myself;
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
The husbandry and manage of my house
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
To live in prayer and contemplation,
Only attended by Nerissa here,
Until her husband and my lord's return:
There is a monastery two miles off;
And there will we abide. I do desire you
Not to deny this imposition;
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you.

 My people do already know my mind,
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
And so farewell, till we shall meet again.

 I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
To wish it back on you: fare you well, Jessica.
[Exeunt Jessica and Lorenzo.
Now, Balthasar,
As I have ever found thee honest-true,
So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
And use thou all the endeavour of a man
In speed to Padua: see thou render this
Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
Unto the tranect; to the common ferry
Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.

 Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
Before they think of us.

 They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
That they shall think we are accomplished
With that we lack.   I'll hold thee any wager,
When we are both accoutred like young men,
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
And speak between the change of man and boy
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
How honorable ladies sought my love,
Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
And wish, for all that, that I had not kill'd them;
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
That men shall swear I have discontinued school
Above a twelvemonth.   I have within my mind
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
Which I will practise.

 Fie, what a question's that,
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
When I am in my coach, which stays for us
At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
For we must measure twenty miles to-day.
[Exeunt.
 I did, my lord.

 I am informed throughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?

 Is your name Shylock?

 Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger, do you not?

 Do you confess the bond?

 Then must the Jew be merciful.

 The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

 Is he not able to discharge the money?

 It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.

 I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

 Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.

 Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.

 Why then, thus it is:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

 For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty,
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.

 Therefore lay bare your bosom.

 It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh?

 Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death.

 It is not so express'd: but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

 You, merchant, have you any thing to say?

 Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.

 A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.

 And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.

 Tarry a little; there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate'
Unto the state of Venice.

 Thyself shalt see the act:
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.

 Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
He shall have nothing but the penalty.

 Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
But in the estimation of a hair,
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.

 Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.

 He hath refused it in the open court:
He shall have merely justice and his bond.

 Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

 Tarry, Jew:
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen,
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly and directly too
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.

 Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.

 What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

 Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?

 Clerk, draw a deed of gift.

 I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
I must away this night toward Padua,
And it is meet I presently set forth.

 He is well paid that is well satisfied;
And I, delivering you, am satisfied
And therein do account myself well paid:
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you, know me when we meet again:
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.

 You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
[To Ant.] Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
[To Bass.] And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
And you in love shall not deny me this.

 I will have nothing else but only this;
And now methinks I have a mind to it.

 I see, sir, you are liberal in offers:
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.

 That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
And know how well I have deserved the ring,
She would not hold out enemy for ever,
For giving it to me.   Well, peace be with you!
[Exeunt Portia and Nerissa. 
 Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
And be a day before our husbands home:
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
Enter GRATIANO.
 That cannot be:
His ring I do accept most thankfully:
And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.

 [Aside to Ner.] Thou mayst, I warrant. We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men;
But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
[Aloud] Away! make haste: thou know'st where I will tarry.

 That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

 So doth the greater glory dim the less:
A substitute shines brightly as a king
Until a king be by, and then his state
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!

 Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

 The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
When neither is attended, and I think
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season season'd are
To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
And would not be awaked. [Music ceases.
 He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
By the bad voice.

 We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
Are they return'd?

 Go in, Nerissa;
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence;
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
                [A tucket sounds.
 This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers.
 Let me give light, but let me not be light;
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
And never be Bassanio so for me:
But God sort all!   You are welcome home, my lord.

 You should in all sense be much bound to him,
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

 Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
It must appear in other ways than words,
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

 A quarrel, ho, already what's the matter?

 You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it; and here he stands;
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
That the world masters.   Now, in faith, Gratiano,
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

 What ring gave you, my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

 Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
Until I see the ring.

 If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
Or your own honor to contain the ring,
You would not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so much unreasonable,
If you had pleased to have defended it
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

 Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you;
I'll not deny him any thing I have,
No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
If you do not, if I be left alone,
Now, by mine honor, which is yet mine own,
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

 Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.

 Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
And there's an oath of credit.

 Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other.

 I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

 Speak not so grossly.   You are all amazed:
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
And even but now return'd; I have not yet
Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
And I have better news in store for you
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
There you shall find three of your argosies
Are richly come to harbor suddenly:
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter.

 How now, Lorenzo!
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.

 It is almost morning.
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these events at full. Let us go in;
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
And we will answer all things faithfully.

"
4,ner.,NERISSA,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-ner.,"              Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
And comes to his election presently.
Flourish of cornets.   Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their trains.

 The ancient saying is no heresy,
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.

 Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!
[Exeunt.
 My lord and lady, it is now our time,
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!

 Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.

 What, and stake down?

 Shall they see us?

 Why, shall we turn to men?

 From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
[Presenting a letter. 
 He attendeth here hard by,
To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.

 'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The wish would make else an unquiet house.

 Sir, I would speak with you.
[Aside to Por.] I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.

 Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
[Exeunt. 
 When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.

 It is your music, madam, of the house.

 Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

 What talk you of the posy or the value?
You swore to me, when I did give it you,
That you would wear it till your hour of death
And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
You should have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.

 Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

 Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine.

 And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection.

 And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

 Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
Unless he live until he be a man.

 Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
There do I give to you and Jessica,
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.

"
5,jes.,JESSICA,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-jes.," I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
Give him this letter; do it secretly;
And so farewell: I would not have my father
See me in talk with thee.

 Farewell, good Launcelot.
 [Exit Launcelot.
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
To be ashamed to be my father's child!
But though I am a daughter to his blood,
I am not to his manners.   O Lorenzo,
If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
Become a Christian and thy loving wife. [Exit.
 Call you? what is your will?

 His words were 'Farewell, mistress;' nothing else.

 Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
I have a father, you a daughter, lost. [Exit.
 Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

 Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
For who love I so much? And now who knows
But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

 Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit;
For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy.

 What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
And I should be obscured.

 I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
[Exit above. 
 When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
Than twenty times the value of the sum
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord.
If law, authority and power deny not,
It will go hard with poor Antonio.

 I wish your ladyship all heart's content.

 And what hope is that, I pray thee?

     Past all expressing.   It is very meet
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
For, having such a blessing in his lady,
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
And if on earth he do not mean it, then
In reason he should never come to heaven.
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
And on the wager lay two earthly women,
And Portia one, there must be something else
Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
Hath not her fellow.

 Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.

 Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.

 Well, I'll set you forth.
[Exeunt. In such a night
Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
And ran dismay'd away.

 In such a night
Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
That did renew old AEson.

 In such a night
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
And ne'er a true one.

 I would out-night you, did no body come;
But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
Enter STEPHANO.
 I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

"
6,lr-8,GONERIL,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-8," Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

 Let your study
Be to content your lord, who hath received you
At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.

     We must do something, and i' the heat.
                                         [Exeunt. Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?

 By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other,
That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
If you come slack of former services,
You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.

 Put on what weary negligence you please,
You and your fellows; I'ld have it come to question:
It he dislike it, let him to our sister,
Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away!   Now, by my life,
Old fools are babes again; and must be used
With checks as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
Remember what I tell you.

 And let his knights have colder looks among you;
What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
                                         [Exeunt. Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,
I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful
By what youself too late have spoke and done,
That you protect this course, and put it on
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
Might in their working do you that offence,
Which else were shame, that then necessity
Will call discreet proceeding.

 I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
These dispositions, that of late transform you
From what you rightly are.

 This admiration, sir, is much o' the savor
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright:
As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
That this our court, infected with their manners,
Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
For instant remedy: be then desired
By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
A little to disquantity your train;
And the remainder, that shall still depend,
To be such men as may besort your age,
And know themselves and you.

 You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
Make servants of their betters.
Enter ALBANY.
 Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
But let this disposition have that scope
That dotage gives it.
Re-enter LEAR.
  Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!
  [To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.

 This man hath had good counsel:--
a hundred knights!
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!

 Safer than trust too far:
Let me still take away the harms I fear,
Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister:
If she sustain him and his hundred knights,
When I have show'd the unfitness,--
Re-enter OSWALD.
How now, Oswald!
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?

 Take you some company, and away to horse:
Inform her full of my particular fear;
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more.  Get you gone;
And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord,
This milky gentleness and course of yours
Though I condemn not yet under pardon,
You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
Than praised for harmful mildness.

  Why not by the hand, sir?   How have I offended?
All's not offence that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so.

 At your choice, sir.

 Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
From those that she calls servants or from mine?

 Hear me, my lord:
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
To follow in a house where twice so many
Have a command to tend you?

 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,
And must needs taste his folly.

 So am I purposed.
Where is my lord of Gloucester?

  My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

   Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

 Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the way.
Enter OSWALD.
Now, where's your master?

 Then shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
If you dare venture in your own behalf,
A mistress's command.   Wear this; spare speech;                   [Giving a favour.
Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
Conceive, and fare thee well.

 My most dear Gloucester!
                                  [Exit Edmund.
O, the difference of man and man!
To thee a woman's services are due:
My fool usurps my body.

 I have been worth the whistle.

  Milk-liver'd man!
That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs:
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
With plumed helm thy state begins threats;
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
'Alack, why does he so?'

 O vain fool!

 Marry, your manhood now--
Enter a Messenger.
 [Aside]One way I like this well;
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
May all the building in my fancy pluck
Upon my hateful life: another way,
The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.
                                            [Exit.
 [Aside]I had rather lose the battle than that sister
Should loosen him and me.

 Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
For these domestic and particular broils
Are not the question here.

 No.

 [Aside]O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.
As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised.
 Not so hot:
In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
More than in your addition.

  That were the most, if he should husband you.

 Holla, holla!
That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.

 Mean you to enjoy him?

 An interlude!

  This is practice, Gloucester:
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
But cozen'd and beguiled.

 Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
Who can arraign me for't?

 Ask me not what I know. [Exit.
"
7,lr-12,REGAN,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-12," Sir, I am made
Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love;
Only she comes too short: that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys,
Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness' love.

 Prescribe not us our duties.

     If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
Which can pursue the offender.   How dost, my lord?

 What, did my father's godson seek your life?
He whom my father named? your Edgar?
Glou. O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!

 Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father?

 No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
That if they come to sojourn at my house,
I'll not be there,

 Thus out of season, threading dark-
eyed night:
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
Wherein we must have use of your advice:
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
Of differences, which I least thought it fit
To answer from our home; the several mes-
sengers
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
Your needful counsel to our business,
Which craves the instant use.

   Sir, being his knave, I will.

 My sister may receive it much more worse,
To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
                    [Kent is put in the stocks.
Come, my good lord, away.
        [Exeunt all but Gloucester and Kent.
  I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty.

 I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
As clears her from all blame.

 O, sir, you are old;
Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
By some discretion, that discerns your state
Better than yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
That to our sister you do make return;
Say you have wrong'd her, sir.

 Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
Return you to my sister.

 O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
When the rash mood is on.

 Good sir, to the purpose.

 I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
That she would soon be here.
Enter OSWALD.
Is your lady come?

 I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
If, till the expiration of your month,
You will return and sojourn with my sister,
Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
I am now from home, and out of that provision
Which shall be needful to your entertainment.

 Not altogether so:
I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
For your fit welcome.   Give ear, sir, to my sister;
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old, and so--
But she knows what she does.

 I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
Is it not well?   What should you need of more?
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
Speak 'gainst so great a number?   How, in one house,
Should many people, under two commands,
Hold amity?   'Tis hard; almost impossible.

 Why not, my lord?   If then they chanced to slack you,
We could control them. If you will come to me,--
For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
To bring but five and twenty: to no more
Will I give place or notice.

 And in good time you gave it.

  What need one?

 This house is little: the old man and his people
Cannot be well bestow'd.

 For this particular, I'll receive him gladly,
But not one follower.

 O, sir, to wilful men,
The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters.   Shut up your doors:
He is attended with a desperate train;
And what they may incense him to, being apt
To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.

   Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!

 So white, and such a traitor!

  To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king?
Speak.

 And false.

  Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--

  Wherefore to Dover, sir?

  How now, you dog!

 Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
     [Takes a sword, and runs at him behind.
 Out, treacherous villain!
Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
Who is too good to pity thee.

 Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
His way to Dover. [Exit one with Gloucester. How is't, my lord? how look you?

 But are my brother's powers set forth?

 Himself in person there?

  Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

  What might import my sister's letter to him?

 'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
To let him live: where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
In pity of his misery, to dispatch
His nighted life; moreover, to descry
The strength o' the enemy.

 Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
The ways are dangerous.

 Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
Let me unseal the letter.

 I know your lady does not love her husband;
I am sure of that: and at her late being here
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund.   I know you are of her bosom.

 I speak in understanding; you are, I know 't:
Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
So, fare you well.
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

 Fare thee well. [Exeunt.
  Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.

 Now sweet lord,
You know the goodness I intend upon you:
Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
Do you not love my sister?

 But have you never found my brother's way
To the forfended place?

 I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.

 I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
Be not familiar with her.

 Why is this reason'd?

 Sister, you'll go with us?

  That's as we list to grace him.
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
Bore the commission of my place and person;
The which immediacy may well stand up,
And call itself your brother.

 In my rights,
By me invested, he compeers the best.

 Jesters do oft prove prophets.

 Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
From a full flowing stomach. General,
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
Witness the world, that I create thee here
My lord and master.

  Sick, O, sick!
 My sickness grows upon me.

"
8,lr-3,CORDELIA,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-3," What shall Cordelia do? Love, and be silent.

 Then poor Cordelia!
And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
More richer than my tongue.

   Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
According to my bond; nor more nor less.

 Good my lord,
You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
Return those duties back as are right fit,
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
They loved you all? Haply, when I shall wed.
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
To love my father all.

 Ay, good my lord.

  So young, my lord, and true.

 I yet beseech your majesty,--
If for I want that glib and oily art,
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
That hath deprived me of your grace and favor;
But even for want of that for which I am richer,
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking.

 Peace be with Burgundy!
Since that respects of fortune are his love,
I shall not be his wife.

 The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
To your professed bosoms I commit him:
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
I would prefer him to a better place.
So, farewell to you both.

 Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
Well may you prosper!

 Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo- flowers,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
Search every acre in the high-grown field,
And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.] What can man's wisdom
In the restoring his bereaved sense?
He that helps him take all my outward worth.

 All blest secrets,
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
In the good man's distress!   Seek, seek for him;
Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it.
Enter a Messenger.
 'Tis known before; our preparation stands
In expectation of them. O dear father,
It is thy business that I go about;
Therefore great France
My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
But love, dear love and our aged father's right:
Soon may I hear and see him!         [Exeunt.
 O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
To match thy goodness?   My life will be too short,
And every measure fail me.

 Be better suited:
These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
I prithee, put them off.

 Then be't so, my good lord. [To the
     Doctor] How does the king?

 O you kind gods,
Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
Of this child-changed father!

 Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?

 Very well.

 O my dear father!   Restoration hang
Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made!

 Had you not been their father, these white flakes
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
To be opposed against the warring winds?
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
With this thin helm?   Mine enemy's dog,
Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.

  Sir, do you know me?

  Still, still, far wide!

 O, look upon me, sir,
And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
No, sir, you must not kneel.

 And so am I, I am.

 No cause, no cause.

 Will't please your highness walk?

 We are not the first
Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

"
9,mir.,MIRANDA,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-mir.," If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek.
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffer'd
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
Against my very heart.   Poor souls, they perish'd.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.

 O, woe the day!

 More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.

 You have often
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

 Certainly, sir, I can.

 'Tis far off
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?

 But that I do not.

 Sir, are not you my father?

 O the heavens!
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
Or blessed was't we did?

 O, my heart bleeds
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
Which is from   my remembrance!   Please you, farther.

 Sir, most heedfully.

 O, good sir, I do.

 Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

 O the heavens!

 I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.

 Alack, for pity!
I, not remembering how I cried out then,
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
That wrings mine eyes to 't.

 Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?

 Alack, what trouble
Was I then to you!

 How came we ashore?

 Would I might
But ever see that man!

 Heavens thank you for 't!   And now, I pray you, sir,
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
For raising this sea-storm?

 The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.

 'Tis a villain, sir,
I do not love to look on.

 What is 't? a spirit?
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
it carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

 I might call him
A thing divine, for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble.

 No wonder, sir;
But certainly a maid.

 Alack, for mercy!

 Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way

 There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with't.

 O dear father,
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
He's gentle and not fearful.

 Beseech you, father.

 Sir, have pity;
I'll be his surety.

 My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.

 Be of comfort;
My father's of a better nature, sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Which now came from him.

 Alas, now, pray you,
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
He's safe for these three hours.

 If you'll sit down,
I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
I'll carry it to the pile.

 It would become me
As well as it does you: and I should do it
With much more ease; for my good will is to it.
And yours it is against.

 You look wearily.

 Miranda.--O my father,
I have broke your hest to say so!

 I do not know
One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you, good friend,
And my dear father: how features are abroad
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you,
Nor can imagination form a shape,
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
Something too wildly and my father's precepts
I therein do forget.

 Do you love me?

 I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of.

 At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
What I desire to give, and much less take
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
And all the more it seeks to hide itself.
The bigger bulk it shows.   Hence, bashful cunning!
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence
I am your wife, if you will marry me,
If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
Whether you will or no.

 My husband, then?

 And mine, with my heart in't: and now farewell
Till half an hour hence,

 Never till this day
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd

 We wish your peace.
[Exeunt.
 Sweet lord, you play me false.

 Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
And I would call it fair play.

 O, wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is!   O brave new world,
That has such people in 't!

"
10,ros.,ROSALIND,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-ros.,"    What shall be our sport, then?

    Where learned you that oath, fool?

 Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

 With his mouth full of news.

 Then shall we be news-crammed.

 As wit and fortune will.

 Thou losest thy old smell.

 Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.

  Alas!

  Is yonder the man?

      Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!

 O excellent young man!

 My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
And all the world was of my father's mind:
Had I before known this young man his son,
I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
Ere he should thus have ventured.

 Gentleman, [Giving him a chain from her neck.
Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
Shall we go, coz?

 He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
More than your enemies.

 Have with you. Fare you well.
[Exeunt Rosalind and Celia.
 Not one to throw at a dog.

    I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.

   No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

  Me, uncle?

 I do beseech your grace,
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
If with myself I hold intelligence
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your highness.

 Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.

 So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I when your highness banish'd him:
Treason is not inherited, my lord;
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
To think my poverty is treacherous.

 I have more cause.

 That he hath not.

 Why, whither shall we go?

 Alas, what danger will it be to us,
Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.

 Were it not better,
Because that I am more than common tall,
That I did suit me all points like a man?
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
As many other mannish cowards have
That do outface it with their semblances.

 I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be call'd?

 But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
The clownish fool out of your father's court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

 O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!

  Well, this is the forest of Arden.

 Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
Enter CORIN and SILVIUS.
Look you, who comes here; a young man and
an old in solemn talk.

 Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
I have by hard adventure found mine own.

 Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.

 Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
Is much upon my fashion.

 Peace, fool; he's not thy kinsman.

 Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.

 I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
And faints for succor.

 What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

 I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.

    From the east to western Ind,
   No jewel is like Rosalind.
   Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
   Through all the world bears Rosalind.
   All the pictures fairest lined
   Are but black to Rosalind.
   Let no fair be kept in mind
   But the fair of Rosalind.

 Out, fool!

   Peace!
Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.

     Is it a man?

 I prithee, who?

 Nay, but who is it?

      Orlando?

    Proceed.

  O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.

  'Tis he: slink by, and note him.

  I pray you, what is't o'clock?

                    Nay, you must call me Rosalind.
Come, sister, will you go?
                               [Exeunt. Never talk to me; I will weep.

 But have I not cause to weep?

  I' faith, his hair is of a good color.

   Do you think so?

 Not true in love?

   O, come, let us remove:
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
                            [Exeunt. And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
That you insult, exult, and all at once,
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
As, by my faith, I see no more in you
Than without candle may go dark to bed--
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
That can entame my spirits to your worship.
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
You are a thousand times a properer man
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
That makes the world full of ill-favor'd children:
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
And out of you she sees herself more proper
Than any of her lineaments can show her.
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.

  I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
For I am falser than vows made in wine:
Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
And be not proud: though all the world could see,
None could be so abused in sight as he.
Come, to our flock.
                       [Exeunt Rosalind, Celia and Corin.
 They say you are a melancholy fellow.

  Why then, 'tis good to be a post.

        And I am your Rosalind.

          Ay, and twenty such.

 Are you not good?

  You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'

 Ay, but when?

     By my life, she will do as I do.

    Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.

       Patience herself would startle at this letter
And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
This is a letter of your own device.

 Come, come, you are a fool
And turn'd into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand,
A freestone-color'd hand; I verily did think
That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
I say she never did invent this letter;
This is a man's invention and his hand.

 Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style,
A style for challengers; why, she defies me,
Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?

 She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
[Reads. 
     Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
     That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
Can a woman rail thus?

      Why, thy godhead laid apart,
     Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
Did you ever hear such railing?
     Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
     That could do no vengeance to me.
Meaning me a beast.
     If the scorn of your bright eyne
     Have power to raise such love in mine,
     Alack, in me what strange effect
     Would they work in mild aspect!
     Whiles you chid me, I did love;
     How then might your prayers move!
     He that brings this love to thee
     Little knows this love in me:
     And by him seal up thy mind;
     Whether that thy youth and kind
     Will the faithful offer take
     Of me and all that I can make;
     Or else by him my love deny,
     And then I'll study how to die.

  I am: what must we understand by this?

 But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?

 Was't you he rescued?

 But, for the bloody napkin?

 I would I were at home.

  Counterfeit, I assure you.

   God save you, brother.

        I care not if I have: it is my study
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
Look upon him, love him; he worships you.

 And I for no woman.

 And I for no woman.

 And so am I for no woman.

   Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:
You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
You will bestow her on Orlando here?

 And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?

 You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?

 But if you do refuse to marry me,
You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

 You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?

 I have promised to make all this matter even.
Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her,
If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
To make these doubts all even.
[Exeunt Rosalind and Celia.
 To you I give myself, for I am yours.
[To Orl.]To you I give myself, for I am yours.

 I'll have no father, if you be not he:
I'll have no husband, if you be not he:
Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.

  By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

 Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?

     Sport! of what color?

  Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

  Or I, I promise thee.

   Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

  And mine, to eke out hers.

 Your heart's desires be with you!

   Were I my father, coz, would I do this?

 Gentle cousin,
Let us go thank him and encourage him:
My father's rough and envious disposition
Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
If you do keep your promises in love
But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
Your mistress shall be happy.

 Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
 Will you go, coz?

   But is all this for your father?

  Hem them away.

 Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

    With his eyes full of anger.
Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords.
 Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

 I did not then entreat to have her stay;
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
I was too young that time to value her;
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
Why so am I; we still have slept together,
Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
Still we went coupled and inseparable.

 Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
I cannot live out of her company.

 O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go ?
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.

 Thou hast not, cousin;
Prithee, be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
Hath banish'd me, his daughter?

 No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
No: let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
Whither to go and what to bear with us;
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.

 To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.

 I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
The like do you: so shalt we pass along
And never stir assailants.

 What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

 Something that hath a reference to my state
No longer Celia, but Aliena.

 He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
And get our jewels and our wealth together,
Devise the fittest time and safest way
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight. Now go we in content
To liberty and not to banishment.
                           [Exeunt.  I pray you, one of you question yond man
If he for gold will give us any food:
I faint almost to death.

 And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
And willingly could waste my time in it.

    Why should this a desert be?
    For it is unpeopled? No:
   Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
    That shall civil sayings show:
   Some, how brief the life of man
    Runs his erring pilgrimage,
   That the stretching of a span
    Buckles in his sum of age;
   Some, of violated vows
    'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
   But upon the fairest boughs,
    Or at every sentence end,
   Will I Rosalinda write,
    Teaching all that read to know
   The quintessence of every sprite
    Heaven would in little show.
   Therefore Heaven Nature charged
    That one body should be fill'd
   With all graces wide-enlarged:
    Nature presently distill'd
   Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
    Cleopatra's majesty,
   Atalanta's better part,
    Sad Lucretia's modesty.
   Thus Rosalind of many parts
    By heavenly synod was devised,
   Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
   To have the touches dearest prized.
Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
And I to live and die her slave.

  Didst thou hear these verses?

   Trow you who hath done this?

   Is it possible?

  So you may put a man in your belly.

 Nay, he hath but a little beard.

  I' faith, coz, 'tis he.

 Orlando.

   Give me audience, good madam.

          Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

     Well, and what of him?

  I cannot say the words.

    And I'll sleep.   [Exeunt.  Alas, poor shepherd!

 West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom:
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
There's none within.

 It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

 I pray you, tell it.

 O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
And he did render him the most unnatural
That lived amongst men.

 Are you his brother?

 Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

 Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!

 There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!

 We'll lead you thither.
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?

 "
12,phe.,PHEBE,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-phe.," I would not be thy executioner:
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
The cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
That can do hurt.

 But till that time
Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
As till that time I shall not pity thee.

 Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.

 For no ill will I bear you.

 Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'

 Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?

 Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.

 Thou hast my love: is not that neighborly?

 Why, that were covetousness.
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
But do not look for further recompense
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

 Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

 Think not I love him, though I ask for him;
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
But what care I for words? yet words do well
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
There was a pretty redness in his lip,
A little riper and more lusty red
Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
Between the constant red and mingled damask.
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
In parcels as I did, would have gone near
To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
For what had he to do to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
And, now I am remembered, scorn'd at me:
I marvel why I answer'd not again:
But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?

 I'll write it straight;
The matter's in my head and in my heart:
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Go with me, Silvius.   [Exeunt. Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
To show the letter that I writ to you.

 Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.

 And I for Ganymede.

 And I for Ganymede.

 And so am I for Ganymede.

  Nor I.

 That will I, should I die the hour after.

 So is the bargain.

 If sight and shape be true,
Why then, my love adieu!

 I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
Enter JAQUES DE BOYS.
"
13,q.-eliz.,ELIZABETH,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-q.-eliz.," If he were dead, what would betide of me?

 The loss of such a lord includes all harm.

 Oh, he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

 It is determined, not concluded yet:
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY.
 The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby,
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

 What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

 God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

 Would all were well! but that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest.
Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET.
 Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
The king, of his own royal disposition,
And not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Which in your outward actions shows itself
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.

 Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends':
God grant we never may have need of you!

 By Him that raised me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

 My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with this condition,
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind.
Small joy have I in being England's queen.

 As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
As little joy may you suppose in me,
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

 So just is God, to right the innocent.

 Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

 I never did her any, to my knowledge.

 Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?

 Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

 A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

 All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!

 Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
I'll join with black despair against my soul,
And to myself become an enemy.

 To make an act of tragic violence:
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.

 Give me no help in lamentation;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints:
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!

 What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone,

 Was never widow had so dear a loss!

 But I hear, no; they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

 A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.

 Pitchers have ears.
Enter a Messenger.
 How fares the prince?

 For what offence?

 Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
I see, as in a map, the end of all.

 Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.

 You have no cause.

 As much to you, good sister! Whither away?

 Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
Enter BRAKENBURY.
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?

 The king! why, who's that?

 The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?

 O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
With this dead-killing news!

 O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell:
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughterhouse,
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.

 Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory;
To feed my humor, wish thyself no harm.

 Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.

 Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!

 Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
Pity, you ancient stones, these tender babes
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
For tender princes, use my babies well!
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
                             [Exeunt. Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your mother's lamentation!

 Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

 O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
[Sitting down by her.
 O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!

 O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

 My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!

 Windy attorneys to their client woes,
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
Poor breathing orators of miseries!
Let them have scope: though what they do impart
Help not at all, yet do they ease the heart.

 Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
Where should be graven, if that right were right,
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?

 Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

 Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
Abides in me; I say amen to all.

 I have no more sons of the royal blood
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
And therefore level not to hit their lives.

 And must she die for this? O, let her live,
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

 To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

 And only in that safety died her brothers.

 No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.

 True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
My babes were destined to a fairer death,
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.

 Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

 What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
To be discovered, that can do me good?

 Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?

 Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honor,
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?

 Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

 My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.

 That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.

 Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

 What, thou?

 How canst thou woo her?

 And wilt thou learn of me?

 Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
Therefore present to her,--as sometime Margaret
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body.
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
If this inducement force her not to love,
Send her a story of thy noble acts;
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

 There is no other way;
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
And not be Richard that hath done all this.

 Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.

 What were I best to say? her father's brother
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
Under what title shall I woo for thee,
That God, the law, my honor and her love,
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?

 Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.

 That at her hands which the king's King forbids.

 To wail the title, as her mother doth.

 But how long shall that title 'ever' last?

 But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?

 So long as hell and Richard likes of it.

 But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.

 An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

 Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.

 O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

 Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break.

 Profaned, dishonor'd, and the third usurp'd.

 By nothing; for this is no oath:
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honor;
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
If something thou wilt swear to be believed,
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.

 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

 Thy life hath that dishonor'd.

 Thyself thyself misusest.

 God's wrong is most of all.
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The unity the king thy brother made
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
Had graced the tender temples of my child,
And both the princes had been breathing here,
Which now, two tender playfellows for dust,
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
What canst thou swear by now?

 That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
The children live, whose parents thou hast slaughter'd,
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.

 Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

 Shall I forget myself to be myself?

 But thou didst kill my children.

 Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

 I go. Write to me very shortly,
And you shall understand from me her mind.

"
14,q.-mar.,MARGARET,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-q.-mar.," And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
Thy honor, state and seat is due to me.

 Out, devil! I remember them too well:
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

 Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.

 A murderous villain, and so still thou art.

 Which God revenge!

 Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world.
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.

 A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.[Advancing.
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
Yet that by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
O gentle villain, do not turn away!

 But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
That will I make before I let thee go.

 I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

 What! were you snarling all before I came.
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And see another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers:   God, I pray him,
That none of you may live your natural age,
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!

 And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
The worm of Conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou rag of honor! thou detested--

 Richard!

 I call thee not.

 Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!

 Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse that poisonous bunch-back'd toad.

 Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.

 To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!

 Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Your fire-new stamp of honor is scarce current.
O, that your young nobility could judge
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

 And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!

 Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
My charity is outrage, life my shame;
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!

 O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy hand,
In sign of league and amity with thee:
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.

 I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
Have not to do with him, beware of him;
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
And all their ministers attend on him.

 What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day,
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
                               [Exit.
 So, now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
A dire induction am I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret:   who comes here?
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK.
 Hover about her; say, that right for right
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.

 Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

 When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.

 If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
Give mine the benefit of seniory,
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
If sorrow can admit society,
[Sitting down with them.
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him;

 Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!

 Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward;
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
Young York he is but boot, because both they
Match not the high perfection of my loss:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
And the beholders of this tragic play,
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
To have him suddenly convey'd away.
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!

 I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation of but what I was;
The flattering index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou joy?
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
For queen, a very caitiff crowned with care;
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
And left thee but a very prey to time;
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
From which even here I slip my weary neck,
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
These English woes will make me smile in France.

 Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
Compare dead happiness with living woe;
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
And he that slew them fouler than he is:
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

 Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
[Exit. 
"
15,duch.,DUCHESS OF YORK,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-duch.," No, boy.

 My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
I do lament the sickness of the king.
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.

 Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess who caused your father's death.

 Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

 Ay, boy.

 What means this scene of rude impatience?

 Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
And lived by looking on his images:
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!

 Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

 What stays had I but they? and they are gone.

 Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
And I will pamper it with lamentations.

 God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!

 I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

 Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.

 Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
ln him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.

 I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.

 How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.

 I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?

 His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.

 What is thy news then?

 Who hath committed them?

 Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors,
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
Self against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or let me die, to look on death no more!

 I'll go along with you.

 Who meets us here? my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
Daughter, well met.

 I am their father's mother; I will see them.

 O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

 Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!
[To Anne]Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!
[To Queen Eliz.]Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.

 So many miseries have crazed my voice,
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

 Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth.
[Sitting down.
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!

 I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.

 O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

 Why should calamity be full of words?

 If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me,
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
Enter KING RICHARD, marching, with drums and trumpets.
 O, she that might have intercepted thee,
By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

 Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

 Art thou my son?

 Then patiently hear my impatience.

 O, let me speak!

 I will be mild and gentle in my speech.

 Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.

 No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, bloody, treacherous,
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
What comfortable hour canst thou name,
That ever graced me in thy company?

 I prithee, hear me speak.

 Hear me a word;
For I shall never speak to thee again.

 Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never look upon thy face again.
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
Than all the complete armor that thon wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
And there the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory.
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
[Exit. 
"
16,anne.,LADY ANNE,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-anne.," Set down, set down your honorable load,
If honor may be shrouded in a hearse,
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
If ever he have wife, let her be made
As miserable by the death of him
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
And still, as you are weary of the weight,
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
Enter GLOUCESTER.
 What black magician conjures up this fiend,
To stop devoted charitable deed?

 What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.

 Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
O earth, which this blood drink'st  revenge his death!
Either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead,
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!

 Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

 O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!

 Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
For these known evils, but to give me leave,
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.

 Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.

 And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

 Why, then they are not dead:
But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.

 Why, then he is alive.

 In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.

 Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
Didst thou not kill this king?

 Dost grant me, hedgehog?   then, God grant me too
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!

 He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

 And thou unfit for any place but hell.

 Some dungeon.

 Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

 I hope so.

 Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.

 If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.

 Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

 I would I were, to be revenged on thee.

 It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.

 His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

 Name him.

 Why, that was he.

 Where is he?

 Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!

 Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.

 Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!

 Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
I will not be the executioner.

 I have already.

 I would I knew thy heart.

 I fear me both are false

 Well, well, put up your sword.

 That shall you know hereafter.

 All men, I hope, live so.

 To take is not to give.

 What is it?

 With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.

 'Tis more than you deserve;
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
Imagine I have said farewell already.
[Exeunt Lady Anne, Tressel, and Berkeley.
 God give your graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day!

 No farther than the Tower: and, as I guess,
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the gentle princes there.

 Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.

 Despiteful tidings!   O unpleasing news!

 And I in all unwillingness will go.
I would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!

 No! why?   When he that is my husband now
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, 'accursed,
For making me, so young, so old a widow!
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
As miserable by the life of thee
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!'
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
For never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

 No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.

 Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!

"
17,jc-38,Portia,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/jc.xml-jc-38," Brutus, my lord!

 Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
Hoping it was but an effect of humor,
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
And could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

 Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
He would embrace the means to come by it.

 Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
To dare the vile contagion of the night
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
You have some sick offence within your mind,
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one,
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
Have had resort to you: for here have been
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
Even from darkness.

 I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
That appertain to you? Am I yourself
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
Of your good pleasure? if it be no more,
Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.

 If this were true, then should I know this secret.
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
Being so father'd and so husbanded?
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
I have made strong proof of my constancy,
Giving myself a voluntary wound
Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience,
And not my husband's secrets?

 I prithee, boy, run to the senatehouse;
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
Why dost thou stay?

 I would have had thee there, and here again,
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
O constancy, be strong upon my side,
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
Art thou here yet?

 Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
For he went sickly forth: and take good note
What Cæsar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy! what noise is that?

 Prithee, listen well;
I heard a bustling rumor, like a fray,
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.

 Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?

 What is't o'clock?

 Is Cæsar yet gone to the Capitol?

 Thou hast some suit to Cæsar, hast thou not?

 Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?

 I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
The heart of woman is ! O Brutus,
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise !
Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
That Cæsar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
Say I am merry: come to me again,
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

Exeunt severally.

After the slander of most stepmothers,
Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
So soon as I can win the offended king,
I will be known your advocate: marry, yet
The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
Your wisdom may inform you.

 You know the peril.
I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
Hath charged you should not speak together.
Exit.
 Be brief, I pray you:
If the king come, I shall incur I know not
How much of his displeasure.   [Aside]  Yet
I'll move him
To walk this way: I never do him wrong,
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
Pays dear for my offences.
Exit.
 Beseech your patience.   Peace,
Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort
Out of your best advice.

 Fie! you must give way.
Enter PISANIO.
Here is your servant. How now, sir!   What news?

 Ha!
No harm, I trust, is done?

 I am very glad on't.

 This hath been
Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honor
He will remain so.

 Pray, walk awhile.

 Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
Make haste: who has the note of them?

 Dispatch.
Exeunt Ladies.
Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?

 I wonder, doctor,
Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
Thy pupil long?   Hast thou not learn'd me how
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
That our great king himself doth woo me oft
For my confections?   Having thus far proceeded,--
Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
That I did amplify my judgement in
Other conclusions? I will try the forces
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
To try the vigour of them and apply
Allayments to their act, and by them gather
Their several virtues and effects.

 O, content thee.
Enter PISANIO.
[Aside]
Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
Will I first work: he's for his master,
And enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!
Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
Take your own way.

 Hark thee, a word.

 No further service, doctor,
Until I send for thee.

 Weeps she still, say'st thou?   Dost thou think in time
She will not quench and let instructions enter
Where folly now possesses?   Do thou work:
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
As great as is thy master, greater, for
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor
Continue where he is: to shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another,
And every day that comes comes to decay
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
To be depender on a thing that leans,
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
So much as but to prop him?  [The Queen drops the box: Pisanio takes it up.] Thou takest up
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labor:
It is a thing I made, which hath the king
Five times redeem'd from   death: I do not know
What is more cordial.   Nay, I prithee, take it;
It is an earnest of a further good
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king
To any shape of thy preferment such
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
That set thee on to this desert, am bound
To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
Think on my words.
[Exit Pisanio.A sly and constant knave,
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master
And the remembrancer of her to hold
The hand-fast to her lord.   I have given him that
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured
To taste of too.

Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies.
So, so: well done, well done:
The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
Think on my words.
Exeunt Queen and Ladies.
 You are most bound to the king,
Who lets go by no vantages that may
Prefer you to his daughter.   Frame yourself
To orderly soliciting, and be friended
With aptness of the season; make denials
Increase your services; so seem as if
You were inspired to do those duties which
You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
Save when command to your dismission tends,
And therein you are senseless.

 And, to kill the marvel,
Shall be so ever.

  That opportunity
Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
The kings your ancestors, together with
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
With rocks unscaleable and roaring waters,
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
 Cæsar made here; but made not here his brag
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame:' with shame--
The first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--
Poor ignorant baubles!--on our terrible seas,
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--
 O giglot fortune!--to master Cæsar's sword,
Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
And Britons strut with courage.

 And you!

 He goes hence frowning: but it honors us
That we have given him cause.

 'Tis not sleepy business;
But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.

 Royal sir,
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,
Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
And strokes death to her.
Re-enter Attendant.
 My lord, when last I went to visit her,
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,
She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
Which daily she was bound to proffer: this
She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
Made me to blame in memory.

 Son, I say, follow the king.

 Go, look after.
[Exit Cloten.
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
It is a thing most precious. But for her,
Where is she gone?   Haply, despair hath seized her,
Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
To death or to dishonor; and my end
Can make good use of either: she being down,
I have the placing of the British crown.
Re-enter CLOTEN.
How now, my son!

 All the better: may
This night forestall him of the coming day!
[Exit.
"
19,imo.,IMOGEN,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-imo.," O
Dissembling courtesy!   How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds!   My dearest husband,
I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--
Always reserved my holy duty--what
His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
But that there is this jewel in the world
That I may see again.

 Nay, stay a little:
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
Such parting were too petty.   Look here, love;
This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;
But keep it till you woo another wife,
When Imogen is dead.

 O the gods!
When shall we see again?
Enter CYMBELINE and Lords.
 There cannot be a pinch in death
More sharp than this is.

 I beseech you, sir,
Harm not yourself with your vexation:
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
Subdues all pangs, all fears.

 Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.

 O blest, that I might not!   I chose an eagle,
And did avoid a puttock.

 No; I rather added
A lustre to it.

 Sir,
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
A man worth any woman, overbuys me
Almost the sum he pays.

 Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
Our neighbour shepherd's son!

 Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
I would they were in Afric both together;
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
The goer-back.   Why came you from your master?

 About some half-hour hence,
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
[Exeunt.  I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
And question'dst every sail: if he should write,
And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
That he spake to thee?

 Then waved his handkerchief?

 Senseless linen! happier therein than I!
And that was all?

 Thou shouldst have made him
As little as a crow, or less, ere left
To after-eye him.

 I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
To look upon him, till the diminution
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,
Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
When shall we hear from him?

 I did not take my leave of him, but had
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
How I would think on him at certain hours
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
The shes of Italy should not betray
Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at mid- night,
To encounter me with orisons, for then
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
Give him that parting kiss which I had set
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
Shakes all our buds from growing.
Enter a Lady.
 Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
I will attend the queen.

 A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
Vexations of it!   Had I been thief-stol'n,
As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,
How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO.
 Thanks, good sir:
You're kindly welcome.

 So far I read aloud:
But even the very middle of my heart
Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
In all that I can do.

 What makes your admiration?

 What is the matter, trow?

 What, dear sir,
Thus raps you? Are you well?

 Continues well my lord?   His health, beseech you?

 Is he disposed to mirth?   I hope he, is.

 When he was here,
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
Not knowing why.

 Will my lord say so?

 Not he, I hope,

 What do you pity, sir?

 Am I one, sir?
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
Deserves your pity?

 I pray you, sir,
Deliver with more openness your answers
To my demands. Why do you pity me?

 You do seem to know
Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--
Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
Than to be sure they do; for certainties
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
The remedy then born--discover to me
What both you spur and stop.

 My lord, I fear,
Has forgot Britain.

 Let me hear no more.

 Revenged!
How should I be revenged?   If this be true,--
As I have such a heart that both mine ears
Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
How should I be revenged?

 What, ho, Pisanio!

 Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
So long attended thee.   If thou wert honorable,
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange
Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
From thy report as thou from honor, and
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
The king my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
As in a Romish stew and to expound
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
He little cares for and a daughter who
He not respects at all.   What, ho, Pisanio!

 You make amends.

 All's well, sir: take my power i' the court for yours.

 Pray, what is't?

 Willingly;
And pawn mine honor for their safety: since
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
In my bedchamber.

 O, no, no.

 I thank you for your pains:
But not away to-morrow!

 I will write.
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
And truly yielded you.   You're very welcome.
Exeunt.  Who's there? my woman Helen?

 What hour is it?

 I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:
Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:
Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,
I prithee, call me.   Sleep hath seized me wholly.
[Exit Lady. 
To your protection I commend me, gods.
From fairies and the tempters of the night
Guard me, beseech ye.
[Sleeps. Iachimo comes from the trunk.
 Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
For purchasing but trouble: the thanks I give
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
And scarce can spare them.

 If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:
If you swear still, your recompense is still
That I regard it not.

 But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
I would not speak.   I pray you, spare me: 'faith,
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
To your best kindness: one of your great knowing
Should learn, being taught, forbearance.

 Fools are not mad folks.

 As I am mad, I do:
If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;
That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
You put me to forget a lady's manners,
By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,
That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
By the very truth of it, I care not for you,
And am so near the lack of charity--
To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather
You felt than make't my boast.

 Profane fellow!
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,
Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
Comparative for your virtues, to be styled
The under-hangman   of his kingdom, and hated
For being preferr'd so well.

 He never can meet more mischance than come
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,
That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer
In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!
Enter PISANIO.
 To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--

 I am sprited with a fool,
Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,
If I would lose it for a revenue
Of any king's in Europe. I do think
I saw't this morning: confident I am
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.

 I hope so: go and search.
[Exit Pisanio.
 Ay, I said so, sir:
If you will make't an action, call witness to't.

 Your mother too:
She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir.
To the worst of discontent.
[Exit.
 How now, Pisanio!

 Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!
O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
That knew the stars as I his characters;
He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,
Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:
Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
For it doth physic love: of his content,
All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:
Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
    [Reads]
O, for a horse with wings!   Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
May plod it in a week, why may not I
Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--
Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--
O, let me bate,--but not like me--yet long'st,
But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;
For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;
Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
To the smothering of the sense--how far it is
To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
To inherit such a haven: but first of all,
How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:
Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
How many score of miles may we well ride
'Twixt hour and hour?

 Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
Could never go so slow: I have heard of riding wagers,
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
That run i' the clock's behalf.   But this is foolery:
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
She'll home to her father: and provide me presently
A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's housewife.

 I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say;
Accessible is none but Milford way.  [Exeunt. Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
To see me first, as I have now.   Pisanio! man!
Where is Posthumus?   What is in thy mind,
That makes thee stare thus?   Wherefore breaks that sigh
From the inward of thee?   One, but painted thus,
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
Beyond self-explication: put thyself
Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness
Vanquish my staider senses.   What's the matter?
Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with
A look untender?   If't be summer news,
Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st
But keep that countenance still.   My husband's hand!
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
May take off some extremity, which to read
Would be even mortal to me.

  False to his bed!   What is it to be false?
To lie in watch there and to think on him?
To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep charge nature,
To break it with a fearful dream of him
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?

 I false!  Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
Thy favor's good enough.   Some jay of Italy
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O
Men's vows are women's traitors!   All good seeming,
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
Put on for villany; not born where't grows,
But worn a bait for ladies.

 True honest men being heard, like false Æneas,
Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
From thy great fail. Come, fellow, be thou honest:
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,
A little witness my obedience: look!
I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart:
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief:
Thy master is not there, who was indeed
The riches of it: do his bidding; strike.
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
But now thou seem'st a coward.

 Why, I must die;
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
No servant of thy master's.   Against self-slaughter
There is a prohibition so divine
That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.
Something's afore't.   Soft, soft! we'll no defence;
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
All turn'd to heresy?   Away, away,
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
Believe false teachers: though those that are betray'd
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
Stands in worse case of woe.
And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
And make me put into contempt the suits
Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
It is no act of common passage, but
A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
That now thou tirest on, how the memory
Will then be pang'd by me.   Prithee, dispatch:
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
When I desire it too.

 Do't, and to bed then.

 Wherefore then
Didst undertake it?   Why hast thou abused
So many miles with a pretence? this place?
Mine action and thine own? our horses' labor?
The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
For my being absent? whereunto I never
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
The elected deer before thee?

 Talk thy tongue weary; speak:
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear,
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.

 Most like;
Bringing me here to kill me.

 Some Roman courtezan.

 Why, good fellow,
What shall I do the while? where bide? how live?
Or in my life what comfort, when I am
Dead to my husband?

 No court, no father; nor no more ado
With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
As fearful as a siege.

 Where then?
Hath Britain all the sun that shines?   Day, night,
Are they not in Britain?     I' the world's volume
Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;
In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think
There's livers out of Britain.

 O, for such means!
Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
I would adventure.

 Nay, be brief:
I see into thy end, and am almost
A man already.

 Thou art all the comfort
The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:
There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even
All that good time will give us: this attempt
I am soldier to, and will abide it with
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.

 Amen: I thank thee.
[Exeunt, severally. I see a man's life is a tedious one:
I have tired myself, and for two nights together
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,
But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
Where they should be relieved.   Two beggars told me
I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,
That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
A punishment or trial?   Yes; no wonder,
When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
Is worse in kings than beggars.   My dear lord!
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,
My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
At point to sink for food. But what is this?
Here is a path to 't: 'tis some savage hold:
I were best not call; I dare not call: yet famine,
Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,
Take or lend.   Ho!   No answer?   Then I'll enter.
Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy
But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.
Such a foe, good heavens! [Exit, to the cave.
Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.
 Good masters, harm me not:
Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought
To have begg'd or bought what I have took: good troth,
I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:
I would have left it on the board so soon
As I had made my meal, and parted
With prayers for the provider.

 I see you're angry:
Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
Have died had I not made it.

 To Milford-Haven.

 Fidele, sir.   I have a kinsman who
Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;
To whom   being going, almost spent with hunger,
I am fall'n in this offence.

 'Mongst friends,
If brothers.   [Aside]
Would it had been so, that they
Had been my father's sons! then had my prize
Been less, and so more equal ballasting
To thee, Posthumus.

 Great men,
That had a court no bigger than this cave,
That did attend themselves and had the virtue
Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by
That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--
Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
I'ld change my sex to be companion with them,
Since Leonatus's false.

 Thanks, sir.

 So man and man should be;
But clay and clay differs in dignity,
Whose dust is both alike.   I am very sick.

 So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
But not so citizen a wanton as
To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;
Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
To one not sociable: I am not very sick,
Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:
I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,
Stealing so poorly.

 I wish ye sport.

 These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have heard!
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:
Experience, O, thou disprovest report!
The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,
I'll now taste of thy drug.  [Swallows some.
 Well or ill,
I am bound to you.

 Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is the way?--
I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?
'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--
I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
But, soft! no bedfellow!--O gods and goddesses!  [Seeing the body of Cloten. 
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
This bloody man, the care on't.   I hope I dream;
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes
Are sometimes like our judgements, blind. Good faith,
I tremble still with fear: but if there be
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is
Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.
A headless man!   The garments of Posthumus!
I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;
His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face--
Murder in heaven?--Hoy!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
Hast here cut off my lord.   To write and read
Be henceforth treacherous!   Damn'd Pisanio
Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--
From this most bravest vessel of the world
Struck the main-top!   O Posthumus! alas,
Where is thy head? where's that?   Ay me! where's that?
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them
Have laid this woe here.   O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
And cordial to me, have I not found it
Murderous to the senses?   That confirms it home:
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!
Give color to my pale cheek with thy blood,
That we the horrider may seem to those
Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!
[Falls on the body. 
Enter Lucius, a Captain and other Officers, and a Soothsayer. 
 I am nothing: or if not,
Nothing to be were better.   This was my master,
A very valiant Briton and a good,
That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
There is no more such masters: I may wander
From east to occident, cry out for service,
Try many, all good, serve truly, never
Find such another master.

 Richard du Champ.   [Aside] If I do
lie and do
No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?

 Fidele, sir.

 I'll follow, sir.  But first, an't please the gods,
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave.
And on it said a century of prayers,
Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
And leaving so his service, follow you,
So please you entertain me.

 I humbly thank your highness.

 No, no: alack,
There's other work in hand: I see a thing
Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,
Must shuffle for itself.

 He is a Roman; no more kin to me
Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,
Am something nearer.

 I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
To give me hearing.

 Fidele, sir.

 My boon is, that this gentleman may render
Of whom he had this ring.

 Peace, my lord; hear, hear--

 O, get thee from my sight;
Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!
Breathe not where princes are.

                     It poison'd me.

 Most like I did, for I was dead.

 Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
Think that you are upon a rock; and now
Throw me again.  [Embracing him.
 Your blessing, sir.
 I am sorry for 't, my lord.

 That headless man
I thought had been my lord.

 No, my lord;
I have got two worlds by't.   O my gentle brothers,
Have we thus met?   O, never say hereafter
But I am truest speaker: you call'd me brother,
When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
When ye were so indeed.

 You are my father too, and did relieve me,
To see this gracious season.

 My good master,
I will yet do you service.

"
20,cor-39,Volumnia,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-39,"   Indeed, you shall not.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
Or all or lose his hire.

 Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
We are fit to bid her welcome.
Exit Gent.
 He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
And tread upon his neck.

Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman.
   One on's father's moods.

 She shall, she shall.

         Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes;
the senate has letters from the general, wherein
he gives my son the whole name of the war:
he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.

    Death, that dark spirit, in's nervy arm doth lie:
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
A sennet. Trumpets sound.
 Enter COMINIUS the general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between  them, CORIOLANUS, crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald.
 Nay, my good soldier, up;
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving honour newly named,—
What is it?—Coriolanus must I call thee?—
But, O, thy wife!

 I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy: only
There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.

 O, sir, sir, sir,
I would have had you put your power well on,
Before you had worn it out.

 You might have been enough the man you are,
With striving less to be so: lesser had been
The thwartings of your dispositions, if
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

 Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage.

 You are too absolute;
Though therein you can never be too noble,
But when extremities speak.   I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
In peace what each of them by the other lose,
That they combine not there.

 If it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour, as in war, since that to both
It stands in like request?

 Because that now it lies you on to speak
To the people; not by your own instruction,
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
But with such words that are but roted in
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
Now, this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words,
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much blood.
I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honour: I am in this,
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you will rather show our general louts
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what that want might ruin.

 I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
And thus far having stretch'd it—here be with them—
Thy knee bussing the stones—for in such business
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
More learned than the ears—waving thy head,
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
As thou hast power and person.

 Prithee now,
Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
Enter COMINIUS.
 He must, and will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

 I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
To have my praise for this, perform a part
Thou hast not done before.

 At thy choice, then:
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy pride thyself.

 Do your will.
Exit.
 Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
And occupations perish!

 My first son,
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee awhile: determine on some course,
More than a wild exposture to each chance
That starts i' the way before thee.

 O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
Requite your love!

 If that I could for weeping, you should hear,—
Nay, and you shall hear some. To Brutus
Will you be gone?

 Ay, fool; is that a shame?   Note but this fool.
Was not a man my father?   Hadst thou foxship
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words?

 More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
His good sword in his hand.

 Bastards and all.
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

 'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not have earth to know.

 Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:—
As far as doth the Capitol exceed
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son—
This lady's husband here, this, do you see?—
Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.

 Take my prayers with you.

Exeunt Tribunes.
I would the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
Of what lies heavy to't.

 Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself.
And so shall starve with feeding.   Come, let's go:
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

 O, stand up blest!
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
I kneel before thee; and unproperly
Show duty, as mistaken all this while
Between the child and parent.

Kneels.
 Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

 This is a poor epitome of yours,
Which by the interpretation of full time
May show like all yourself.

 Your knee, sirrah.

 Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
Are suitors to you.

 O, no more, no more!
You have said you will not grant us any thing;
For we have nothing else to ask, but that
Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
That, if you fail in our request, the blame
May hang upon your hardness: therefore, hear us.

 Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
And state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile.   Think with thyself
How more unfortunate than all living women
Are we come hither: since that thy sight, which should
Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
Constrains them   weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
Making the mother, wife and child to see
The son, the husband and the father tearing
His country's bowels out. And to poor we
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
Alas, how can we for our country pray,
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
Our comfort in the country. We must find
An evident calamity, though we had
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
With manacles through our streets, or else
Triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and children's blood.   For myself, son,
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
March to assault thy country than to tread—
Trust to 't, thou shalt not—on thy mother's womb,
That brought thee to this world.

 Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
Is, that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
'This we received;' and each in either side
Give the all-hail to thee, and cry 'Be blest
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
Whose chronicle thus writ:   'The man was noble,
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
To imitate the graces of the gods;
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak ?
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
Still to remember wrongs?   Daughter, speak you:
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
More bound to's mother; yet here he lets me prate
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
Down, ladies; let us shame him   with our knees.
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
And die among our neighbours.   Nay, behold 's:
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have,
But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny't. Come, let us go:
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
I am hush'd until our city be afire,
And then I'll speak a little.

He holds her by the hand, silent.

In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

 Where the place?

 I come, Graymalkin!

 Where hath thou been, sister?

 A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--'Give me,' quoth I:
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

 Thou'rt kind.

 I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his pent-house lid;
He shall live a man forbid:
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
Though his bark cannot be lost,
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
Look what I have.

 Here I have a pilot's thumb,
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
Drum within.
 All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!

 Hail!

 Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

 Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

 Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.

 Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.
Exeunt. Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.

 Round about the cauldron go;
In the poison'd entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty one
Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.

 Speak.

 Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
Or from our masters?

 Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
From the murderer's gibbet throw,
Into the flame.

Hear his speech, but say thou nought.

 He will not be commanded:  here's another,
More potent than the first.
Thunder.

 Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
And show the best of our delights:

While you perform your antic round;
That this great king may kindly say,
Our duties did his welcome pay.

22,lady-m.,Lady Macbeth,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mac.xml-lady-m.," Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.'   Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.
Enter a Messenger.
What is your tidings?

 Thou'rt mad to say it:
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation.

 Give him tending;
He brings great news. Exit Messenger.
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief!   Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!' Enter MACBETH.
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.

 And when goes hence?

 O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under 't. He that's coming
Must be provided for: and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

 Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.
Exeunt. All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
We rest your hermits.

 Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs in compt,
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
Still to return your own.

 He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?

 Know you not he has?

 Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely?   From this time
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valour
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
Like the poor cat i' the adage?

 What beast was't, then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
And, to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this.

 We fail!
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?

 Who dares receive it other,
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
Upon his death?

 That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath give my fire.
Hark!Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern'st good-night.   He is about it:
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die.

 Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
Confounds us. Hark!   I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done't.
Enter MACBETH.
My husband!

 I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?

 Now.

 Ay.

 Donalbain.

 There are two lodged together.

 Consider it not so deeply.

 These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

 What do you mean?

 Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
You do unbend your noble strength, to think
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood.

 Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
For it must seem their guilt.
[Exit. Knocking within.
 My hands are of your colour; but I shame
To wear a heart so white. [Knocking within.] I hear a knocking
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber:
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it, then!   Your constancy
Hath left you unattended. [Knocking within.]
Hark! more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts.

 What's the business,
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!

 Woe, alas!
What, in our house?

 Help me hence, ho!

 If he had been forgotten,
It had been as a gap in our great feast,
And all-thing unbecoming.

 Is Banquo gone from court?

 Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
For a few words.

 Nought's had, all's spent,
Where our desire is got without content:
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
Enter MACBETH.
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on?   Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what's done is done.

 Come on;
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
Be bright and jovial among your guests to night.

 You must leave this.

 But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

 What's to be done?

 Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
For my heart speaks they are welcome.
First Murderer appears at the door.
 My royal lord,
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it.

 Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well: if much you note him,
You shall offend him and extend his passion:
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?

 O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear:
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
Led you to Duncan.   O, these flaws and starts,
Impostors to true fear, would well become
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces!   When all's done,
You look but on a stool.

 What, quite unmann'd in folly?

 Fie, for shame!

 My worthy lord,
Your noble friends do lack you.

 Think of this, good peers,
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

 You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
With most admired disorder.

 I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
Question enrages him. At once, good night:
Stand not upon the order of your going,
But go at once.

 A kind good night to all!
Exeunt all but Macbeth and Lady M.
 Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

 Did you send to him, sir?

 You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

23,la.-cap.,LADY CAPULET,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-la.-cap.," A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

 Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

 This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

   Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

 Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?

 Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid.   Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

 Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

 What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament
And see how one another lends content,
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.

 Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

 We follow thee. Exit Servant.
Juliet, the county stays.

 Tybalt, my cousin!  O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
Of my dear kinsman!  Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!

 He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them   fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

 I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

 Ho, daughter! are you up?

 Why, how now, Juliet!

 Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

 So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.

 Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
As that the villain lives which slaughtered him.

 That same villain, Romeo.

 That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

 We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Then weep no more.   I'll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

 Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

 Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

 Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

 Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.
Enter CAPULET and Nurse.
 Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave!

 Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

 You are too hot.

 Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

Exit.
 No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

 We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.

 What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

 Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.
 Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

 Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.

Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.
 What noise is here?

 What is the matter?

 O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help! Call help.
Enter CAPULET.
 Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

 O woful time!

 Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch'd it from   my sight!

 The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry, toward our monument.

 O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
Enter MONTAGUE and others.

24,jul.,JULIET,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-jul.," How now! who calls?

 Madam, I am here,
What is your will?

 And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

 It is an honour that I dream not of.

 I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
Enter a Servant.
 Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

 Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

 Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

 Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

 You kiss by the book.

 Come hither, nurse.   What is yond gentleman?

 What's he that now is going out of door?

 What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

 Go, ask his name: if he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

 My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.

 A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.
One calls within
'Juliet.'

 Ay me!

 O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man.   O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain thy dear perfection which he owes
Without that title.   Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

 What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

 My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

 How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

 If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

 I would not for the world they saw thee here.

 By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

 Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me?   I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet, if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries,
They say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Of if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

 O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

 Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.

 Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by   summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

 What satisfaction canst thou have to. night?

 I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.

 But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.

Nurse calls within.
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse!   Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

Exit, above.
 Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

 I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--

 By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.

 A thousand times good night!

Exit, above.
 Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

 Romeo!

 At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?

 I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

 I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.

 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

 Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

Exit above.
 The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And   therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes!
Enter Nurse and PETER.
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him ?   Send thy man away.

 Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though the news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.

 I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

 How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either. and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

 No, no: but all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?

 I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

 Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'

 Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

 I have.

 Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
Exeunt
 Good even to my ghostly confessor.

 As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

 Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

 Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a waggoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
Enter Nurse, with cords.
Now, nurse, what news?   What hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo did thee fetch?

 Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

 Can heaven be so envious?

 What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe,

 O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

 What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living if those two are gone?

 O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

 O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
When thou didst bower the spirit of fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound?   O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!

 Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

 Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentation might have moved?
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'
There is no end. no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

 Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords, come nurse; I'll to my weddingbed;
And death, not Romeo take my maidenhead!

 O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.

Exeunt.
 Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

 Yond light is not day-light, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet: thou, need'st not to be gone.

 It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes;
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

 Nurse?

 Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

 Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

 O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

 O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb;
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

 O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
That is renown'd for faith?   Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back.


 Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
Enter LADY CAPULET.
 Madam, I am not well.

 Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

 Feeling so the loss,
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

 What villain, madam?

 Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

 Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

 Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd:
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him named, and cannot come to him,
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!

 And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

 Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

 Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at his haste; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

 Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

 Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

 Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

 O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven   should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.

 Speakest thou from thy heart?

 Amen!

 Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolved.

 Ancient damnation!   O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times?   Go, counsellor;
Thou   and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

Exit.
 That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

 What must be shall be.

 To answer that, I should confess to you.

 I will confess to you that I love him.

 If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

 The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.

 That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

 It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

 O, shut the door and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

 Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

 O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless-skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

 Give me, give me!   O, tell not me of fear!

 Love give me strength and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!
Exeunt.
 Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

 I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.

 Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

 Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night;
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.
Enter LADY CAPULET.
 No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
In this so sudden business.

 Farewell!   God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold feat thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse!  What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
Laying down her dagger.
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, I should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That   living   mortals,   hearing   them,   run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefathers' joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
She falls upon her bed, within the curtains.
 O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
Noise within.
 Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Exit Fri. L. 
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after?   I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.
Kisses him.
Thy lips are warm.

 Yea, noise? then I'll be brief.   O happy dagger!
Snatching Romeo's dagger.
This is thy sheath Stabs herself ; there rust, and let me die.
Falls on Romeo's body, and dies.
Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS.
"
25,nurse.,Nurse to Juliet,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-nurse.," Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old.
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
God forbid!   Where's this girl?     What, Juliet!
Enter JULIET.
 Your mother.

  I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

 Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas--eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me; but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
'Shake' quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying and said, 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

 Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

 Peace, I have done.   God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once,
I have my wish.

 An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

 A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

 Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

 No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

 Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Exeunt. 
 Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

 Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous:
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.

 The son and heir of old Tiberio.

 Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

 I know not.

 His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.

 What's this? what's this?

 Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

Exeunt.
 Madam!

 Madam!

                Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark, you, sir.

 Is your man secret?   Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

     Peter, stay at the gate.
Exit Peter.
 I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

 Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?

  Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t'other side,--O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

  O God's lady dear!
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

 Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

 Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

 Ay, ay, the cords.

Throws them down.
 Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

 Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

 I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

 O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!

 Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

 It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

 There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!

 Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

 Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

 Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

 Let me come in, and you shall know my errand;
I come from Lady Juliet.

 O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

 O, he is even in my mistress's case,
Just in her case!   O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament!   Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, an you be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
Why should you fall into so deep an O?

 Ah sir! ah sir!   Well, death's the end of all.

 O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.

 O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

 Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

Exit.
 Madam

 Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary, look about.
Exit.
 God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

 I speak no treason.

 May not one speak?

 Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath.   Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.

 And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.

 What?

 Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
Exit. 
 Ay, forsooth.

 See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
Enter JULIET.
 They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Enter CAPULET.
 Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, you'll be sick tomorrow
For this night's watching.

 Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I must needs wake her.   Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed:
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
Undraws the curtains.
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
I must needs wake you:   Lady! lady! lady!
Alas, alas!   Help, help! my lady's dead!
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
Some aqua vita, ho!   My lord! my lady!
Enter LADY CAPULET.
 O lamentable day!

 Look, look! O heavy day!

 She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

 O lamentable day!

 O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day, O woful day!

 Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

Exit.
"
26,q.-kath.,QUEEN KATHARINE,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-q.-kath.," Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.

 Thank your majesty.
That you would love yourself, and in that love
Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor
The dignity of your office, is the point
Of my petition.

 I am solicited, not by a few,
And those of true condition, that your subjects
Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart
Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,
My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches
Most bitterly on you, as putter on
Of these exactions, yet the king our master--
Whose honour heaven shield from soil!-even he escapes not
Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
The sides of loyalty, and almost appears
In loud rebellion.

 No, my lord,
You know no more than others; but you frame
Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome
To those which would not know them, and yet must
Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,
Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
Most pestilent to the hearing; and, to bear em,
The back is sacrifice to the load. They say
They are devised by you; or else you suffer
Too hard an exclamation.

 I am much too venturous
In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd
Under your promised pardon.   The subjects' grief
Comes through commissions, which compel from each
The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
Without delay; and the pretence for this
Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:
Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
Allegiance in them; their curses now
Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,
This tractable obedience is a slave
To each incensed will. I would your highness
Would give it quick consideration, for
There is no primer business.

 I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
Is run in your displeasure.

 My learn'd lord cardinal,
Deliver all with charity.

 If I know you well,
You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office
On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed
You charge not in your spleen a noble person
And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;
Yes, heartily beseech you.

 God mend all!

 Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;
And to bestow your pity on me: for
I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,
Born out of your dominions; having here
No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance
Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,
In what have I offended you? what cause
Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure,
That thus you should proceed to put me off,
And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
I have been to you a true and humble wife,
At all times to your will conformable;
Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry
As I saw it inclined: when was the hour
I ever contradicted your desire,
Or made it not mine too?   Or which of your friends
Have I not strove to love, although I knew
He were mine enemy? what friend of mine
That had to him derived your anger, did I
Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice
He was from thence discharged?   Sir, call to mind
That I have been your wife, in this obedience,
Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
With many children by you: if, in the course
And process of this time, you can report,
And prove it too, against mine honour aught,
My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,
Against your sacred person, in God's name,
Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt
Shut door upon me, and so give me up
To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir,
The king, your father, was reputed for
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
And unmatch'd wit and judgement: Ferdinand,
My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one
The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
A year before: it is not to be question'd
That they had gather'd a wise council to them
Of every realm, that did debate this business,
Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly
Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may
Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel
I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,
Your pleasure be fulfill'd!

 Lord cardinal,
To you I speak.

 Sir,
I am about to weep; but, thinking that
We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain
The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
I'll turn to sparks of fire.

 I will, when you are humble; nay, before,
Or God will punish me. I do believe,
Induced by potent circumstances, that
You are mine enemy, and make my challenge
You shall not be my judge: for it is you
Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;
Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,
I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul
Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
I hold my most malicious foe, and think not
At all a friend to truth.

 My lord, my lord,
I am a simple woman, much too weak
To oppose your cunning. You're meek and humble-mouth'd;
You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,
With meekness and humility; but your heart
Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,
Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted
Where powers are your retainers, and your words,
Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,
You tender more your person's honour than
Your high profession spiritual: that again
I do refuse you for my judge; and here,
Before you all, appeal unto the pope,
To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,
And to be judged by him.

She curtsies to the King, and offers to depart.
 What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:
When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,
They vex me past my patience!   Pray you, pass on:
I will not tarry; no, nor ever more
Upon this business my appearance make
In any of ther courts.

Exeunt Queen, and her Attendants.
 Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;
Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst: leave working. How now!

 Would they speak with me?

 Pray their graces
To come near. [Exit Gent.
What can be their business
With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?
I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,
They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:
But all hoods make not monks.
Enter the two Cardinals, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS.
 Your graces find me here part of a housewife,
I would be all, against the worst may happen.
What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?

 Speak it here;
There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,
Deserves a corner: would all other women
Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
My lords, I care not, so much I am happy
Above a number, if my actions
Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,
Envy and base opinion set against 'em,
I know my life so even. If your business
Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,
Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.

 O, good my lord, no Latin;
I am not such a truant since my coming,
As not to know the language I have lived in:
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,
If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;
Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,
The willing'st sin I ever yet committed
May be absolved in English.

 To betray me.--
My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;
Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!
But how to make ye suddenly an answer,
In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--
More near my lfe, I fear,--with my weak wit,
And to such men of gravity and learning,
In truth, I know not. I was set at work
Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking
Either for such men or such business.
For her sake that I have been,--for I feel
The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,
Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!

 In England
But little for my profit: can you think, lords,
That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness pleasure,
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,
And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,
They that must weigh out my afflictions,
They that my trust must grow to, live not here:
They are, as all my other comforts, far hence
In mine own country, lords.

 How, sir?

 Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:
Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!
Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
That no king can corrupt.

 The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,
Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
But cardinal sins and nollow hearts I fear ye:
Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
I will not wish ye half my miseries;
I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;
Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once
The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.

 Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye
And all such false professors; would you have me--
If you have any justice, any pity;
If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,
His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,
And all the fellowship I hold now with him
Is only my obedience. What can happen
To me above this wretchedness? all your studies
Make me a curse like this.

 Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,
Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
Never yet branded with suspicion?
Have I with all my full affections
Still met the king? loved him next heaven? obey'd him?
Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.
Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;
And to that woman, when she has done most,
Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.

 My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,
To give up willingly that noble title
Your master wed me to: nothing but death
Shall e'er divorce my dignities.

 Would I had never trod this English earth,
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
What will become of me now, wretched lady!
I am the most unhappy woman living.
Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!
Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,
No friends, no hope; no kindred weep for me;
Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,
That once was mistress of the field and flourished,
I'll hang my head and perish.

 Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,
If I have used myself unmannerly;
You know I am a woman, lacking wit
To make a seemly answer to such persons.
Pray, do my service to his majesty:
He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers
While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,
Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,
That little thought, when she set footing here,
She should have bought her dignities so dear.

[Exeunt.
"
27,kath.,QUEEN KATHARINE,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-kath.," O Griffith, sick to death!
My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,
Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:
So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,
That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,
Was dead?

 Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:
If well, he stepp'd before me, happily
For my example.

 Alas, poor man!

 So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
And yet with charity. He was a man
Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
Himself with princes, one that, by suggestion,
Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;
His own opinion was his law: i' the presence
He would say untruths; and be ever double
Both in his words and meaning: he was never,
But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
But his performance, as he is now, nothing:
Of his own body he was ill, and gave
The clergy ill example.

 Yes, good Griffith;
I were malicious else.

 After my death I wish no other herald,
No other speaker of my living actions,
To keep mine honour from corruption,
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,
With thy religious truth and modesty,
Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!
Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:
I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,
Cause the musicians play me that sad note
I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating
On that celestial harmony I go to.

Sad and solemn music.
 Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?

 It is not you I call for:
Saw ye none enter since I slept?

 No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces
Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?
They promised me eternal happiness;
And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.

 Bid the music leave,
They are harsh and heavy to me.
Music ceases.
 You are a saucy fellow:
Deserve we no more reverence?

 Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow
Let me ne'er see again.

Exeunt Griffith and Messenger.
Re-enter GRIFFTH, with CAPUCIUS. 
If my sight fail not,
You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,
My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.

 O, my lord,
The times and titles now are alter'd strangely
With me since first you knew me.   But, I pray you,
What is your pleasure with me?

 O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;
'Tis like a pardon after execution:
That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;
But now I am past all comforts here, but prayers.
How does his highness?

 So may he ever do! and ever flourish,
When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name
Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,
I caused you write, yet sent away?

 Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver
This to my lord the king.

 In which I have commended to his goodness
The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter:
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding,--
She is young, and of a noble modest nature,
I hope she will deserve well,--and a little.
To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,
Heaven knows how dearly.   My next poor petition
Is, that his noble grace would have some pity
Upon my wretched women, that so long
Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:
Of which there is not one, I dare avow,
And now I should not lie, but will deserve,
For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
For honesty and decent carriage,
A right good husband, let him be a noble:
And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.
The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,
But poverty could never draw 'em from me;
That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,
And something over to remember me by:
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
And able means, we had not parted thus.
These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,
By that you love the dearest in this world,
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,
Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king
To do me this last right.

 I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
In all humility unto his highness:
Say his long trouble now is passing
Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,
You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;
Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,
Let me be used with honour: strew me over
With maiden flowers, that all the world may know
I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,
Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
I can no more.
Exeunt, leading Katharine.
"
28,anne.,ANNE BULLEN,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-anne.," Was he mad, sir?

 You are a merry gamester,
My Lord Sands.

 You cannot show me.

 Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:
His highness having lived so long with her, and she
So good a lady that no tongue could ever
Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,
She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after
So many courses of the sun enthroned,
Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,
To give her the avaunt! it is a pity
Would move a monster.

 O, God's will! much better
She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,
Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging
As soul and body's severing.

 So much the more
Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,
And range with humble livers in content,
Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,
And wear a golden sorrow.

 By my troth and maidenhead,
I would not be a queen.

 Nay, good troth.

 No, not for all the riches under heaven.

 No, in truth.

 How you do talk!
I swear again, I would not be a queen
For all the world.

 My good lord,
Not your demand; it values not your asking:
Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.

 Now, I pray God, amen!

 I do not know
What kind of my obedience I should tender;
More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes
More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes
Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,
Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,
As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;
Whose health and royalty I pray for.

 My honour'd lord.

 This is strange to me.

 Come, you are pleasant.

 Good lady,
Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,
And leave me out on 't. Would I had no being,
If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,
To think what follows.
The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful
In our long absence: pray, do not deliver
What here you've heard to her.

"
29,old-l.,An old Lady,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-old-l.," Hearts of most hard temper
Melt and lament for her.

 Alas: poor lady!
She's a stranger now again.

 Our content
Is our best having.

 Beshrew me, I would,
And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,
For all this spice of your hypocrisy:
You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,
Have too a woman's heart: which ever yet
Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;
Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,
Saving your mincing, the capacity
Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,
If you might please to stretch it.

 Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?

 'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,
Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,
What think you of a duchess? have you limbs
To bear that load of title?

 Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;
I would not be a young count in your way,
For more than blushing comes to: if your back
Cannot vouchsafe this burthen, 'tis too weak
Ever to get a boy.

 In faith, for little England
You'ld venture an emballing: I myself
Would   for Carnarvonshire, although there 'long'd
No more to the crown but that.   Lo, who comes here?
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN. 
 Why, this it is; see, see!
I have been begging sixteen years in court,
And yet a courtier beggarly, nor could
Come pat betwixt too early and too late
For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!
A very fresh fish here--fie, fie, fie upon
This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up
Before you open it.

 How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no.
There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,
That would not be a queen, that would she not,
For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?

 With your theme, I could
O'ermount the lark.   The Marchioness of Pembroke!
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!
No other obligation! By my life,
That promises moe thousands: honour's train
Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time
I know your back will bear a duchess: say,
Are you not stronger than you were?

 What do you think me?

[Exeunt.
 I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring
Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels
Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person
Under their blessed wings!

 Ay, ay, my liege;
And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven
Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,
Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
Desires your visitation, and to be
Acquainted with this stranger: 'tis as like you
As cherry is to cherry.

 An hundred marks by this light, I'll ha' more.
An ordinary groom is for such payment.
I will have more, or scold it out of him.
Said I for this, the girl was like to him?
I will have more, or else unsay 't; and now,
While it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.

To make a stale of me amongst these mates?

 I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
I wis it is not half way to her heart;
But if it were, doubt not her care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool.

 A pretty peat! it is best
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.

  Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.

 Minion, thou liest.   Is't not Hortensio?

 O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.

 If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
Strikes her.
Enter BAPTISTA.
 Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
Flies after Bianca. 
 What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.

 Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call my Katharine that do talk of me.

 Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.

 A join'd-stool.

 Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

 No such jade as you, if me you mean.

 Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

 Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

 Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

 If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

 Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.

 In his tongue.

 Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.

 That I'll try.
She strikes him. 
 So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.

 What is your crest? a coxcomb?

 No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.

 It is my fashion, when I see a crab.

 There is, there is.

 Had I a glass, I would.

 Well aim'd of such a young one.

 Yet you are wither'd.

 I care not.

 I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.

 Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

 Where did you study all this goodly speech?

 A witty mother! witless else her son.

 Yes; keep you warm.

 Call you me daughter? now, I promise you,
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

 I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

 No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour:
And, to be noted for a merry man,
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
Now must the world point at poor Katharine,
And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
If it would please him come and marry her!'

 Would Katharine had never seen him though!
Exit weeping, followed by Bianca and others.
 Let me entreat you.

 Are you content to stay?

 Now, if you love me, stay.

 Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.

 I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
Father, be quiet: he shall stay my leisure.

 Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
I see a woman may be made a fool,
If she had not a spirit to resist.

 Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.

 I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you were so contented.

 The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
What, did he marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that come unto my father's door
Upon entreaty have a present alms;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Nor never needed that I should entreat,
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that which spites me more than all these wants,
He does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

 'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.

 I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.

 A dish that I do love to feed upon.

 Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.

 Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.

 Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
Beats him.
That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
That triumph thus upon my misery
Go, get thee gone, I say.
Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat.
 Faith, as cold as can be.

 I pray you, let it stand.

 I thank you, sir.

 I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.

 Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears,
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
Or else my heart concealing it will break,
And rather than it shall, I will be free
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

 Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none.

Exit Haberdasher.
 I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

 I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.

 The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.

 I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

 Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
And if you please to call it a rush-candle,
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.

 I know it is the moon.

 Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
And the moon changes even as your mind.
What you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it shall be so for Katharine.

 Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
Whither away, or where is thy abode?
Happy the parents of so fair a child;
Happier the man, whom favourable stars
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!

 Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green:
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

 Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.

 What, in the midst of the street?

 No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.

 Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.

 Mistress, how mean you that?

 'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.

 A very mean meaning.

 And I am mean indeed, respecting you.

 What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

 They sit conferring by the parlour fire.

 Fie, fie!   unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, they sovereign; one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I am ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace,
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your husband's foot:
In token of which duty, if he please,
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

"
31,bian.,BIANCA,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-bian.," Sister, content you in my discontent.
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my company,
On them to look and practise by myself.

 Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
Or what you will command me will I do,
So well I know my duty to my elders.

 Believe, me, sister, of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.

 If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.

 Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while:
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

 Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
But learn my lessons as I please myself.
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

 Where left we last?

 Construe them.

 Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.

  In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

 I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

 Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

 ""'Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
'A re,' to plead Hortensio's passion;
'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.""
Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:
Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
To change true rules for old inventions.
                Enter a Servant.
 Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.
Exeunt Bianca and Servant. 
 That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

 What, master, read you? first resolve me that.

 And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

 Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?

 God give him joy!

 He says so, Tranio.

 The taming-school! what, is there such a place?

 Pardon, dear father.

 Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

 Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

 Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.
Exeunt Bianca, Katharina, and Widow.
 Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?

 The more fool you, for laying on my duty.

"
32,eli.,QUEEN ELINOR,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-eli.," A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'

 What now, my son! have I not ever said
How that ambitious Constance would not cease
Till she had kindled France and all the world,
Upon the right and party of her son?
This might have been prevented and made whole
With very easy arguments of love,
Which now   the manage of two kingdoms must
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.

 Your strong possession much more than your right,
Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.
Enter a Sheriff.
Essex. My liege, here is the strangest controversy
Come from the country to be judged by you
That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?

 Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
And wound her honor with this diffidence.

 He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
Do you not read some tokens of my son
In the large composition of this man?

 Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?

 I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
I am a soldier and now bound to France.

 Nay, I would have you go before me thither.

 The very spirit of Plantagenet!
I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.

 Who is it thou dost call usurper; France?

 Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,
That thou mayst be a queen, and check the world!

 There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.

 Come to thy grandam, child.

 His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.

 Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!

 Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
A will that bars the title of thy son.

 Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
Give with our niece a dowry large enough:
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
The bloom   that promiseth a mighty fruit.
I see a yielding in the looks of France;
Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls
Are capable of this ambition,
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
Cool and congeal again to what it was.

 Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.

 O foul revolt of French inconstancy!

 Farewell, gentle cousin.

 Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.

 My blessing go with thee!

"
33,const.,CONSTANCE,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-const.," O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
To make a more requital to your love!

 Stay for an answer to your embassy,
Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
That right in peace which here we urge in war,
And then we shall repent each drop of blood
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
Enter CHATILLON.
 Let me make answer; thy usurping son.

 My bed was ever to thy son as true
As thine was to thy husband; and this boy
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
Than thou and John in manners; being as like
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.
My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think
His father never was so true begot:
It cannot be, as if thou wert his mother.

 There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.

 Do, child, go to it grandam, child;
Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:
There's a good grandam.

 Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!
His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
To do him justice and revenge on you.

 Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!
Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp
The dominations, royalties and rights
Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,
Infortunate in nothing but in thee:
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;
The canon of the law is laid on him.
Being but the second generation
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.

 I have but this to say,
That he is not only plagued for her sin,
But God hath made her sin and her the plague
On this removed issue, plagued for her
And with her plague; her sin his injury,
Her injury the beadle to her sin,
All punish'd in the person of this child,
And all for her; a plague upon her!

 Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will;
A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!

 Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!
Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?
It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard;
Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:
It cannot be thou dost but say 'tis so:
I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word
Is but the vain breath of a common man:
Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;
I have a king's oath to the contrary.
Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
For I am sick and capable of fears,
Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,
A woman, naturally born to fears;
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,
But they will quake and tremble all this day.
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
Then speak again; not all thy former tale,
But this one word, whether thy tale be true.

 O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,
And let belief and life encounter so
As doth the fury of two desperate men
Which in the very meeting fall and die.
Lewis marry Blanch!   O boy, then where art thou?
France friend with England, what becomes of me?
Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.

 Which harm within itself so heinous is
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.

 If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
I would not care, I then would be content,
For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou
Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;
She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,
And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
And leave those woes alone which I alone
Am bound to under-bear.

 Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
To me and to the state of my great grief
Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
That no supporter but the huge firm earth
Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;
Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.
Seats herself on the ground.
Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILIP, LEWIS,   BLANCH, ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA,   and Attendants. 
 A wicked day, and not a holy day!
[Rising.
What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,
That it in golden letters should be set
Among the high tides in the calendar?
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
This day of shame, oppression, perjury.
Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child
Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
No bargains break that are not this day made:
This day, all things begun come to ill end,
Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!

 You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,
Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
Is cold in amity and painted peace,
And our oppression hath made up this league.
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!
A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,
Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings
Hear me, O, hear me!

 War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war.
O Lymoges!   O Austria! thou dost shame
That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
Thou little valiant, great in villany!
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,
And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
Upon my party!   Thou cold-blooded slave,
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.

 O, lawful let it be
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
Good father cardinal, cry thou amen
To my keen curses: for without my wrong
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.

 And for mine too: when law can do no right,
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?

 Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,
And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.

 What should he say, but as the cardinal?

 O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.

 O, if thou grant my need,
Which only lives but by the death of faith,
That need must needs infer this principle,
That faith would live again by death of need.
O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!

 O, be removed from him, and answer well!

 O, upon my knee
Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
Forethought by heaven!

 That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
His honor: O, thine honor, Lewis, thine honor!

 O fair return of banish'd majesty!

 Lo, now! now see the issue of your peace.

 No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
But that which ends all counsel, true redress,
Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
Thou odoriferous stench! sound rottenness!
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
And I will kiss thy detestable bones
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
And ring these fingers with thy household worms
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
And be a carrion monster like thyself:
Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,
O, come to me!

 No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
Then with a passion I would shake the world;
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,
Which scorns a modern invocation.

 Thou art not holy to belie me so;
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:
O, if I could, what grief I should forget
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;
For being not mad but sensible of grief,
My reasonable part produces reason
How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
And teaches me to kill or hang myself:
If I were mad, I should forget my son,
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:
I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
The different plague of each calamity.

 To England, if you will.

 Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
'O that these hands could so redeem my son,
As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
But now I envy at their liberty,
And will again commit them to their bonds,
Because my poor child is a prisoner.
And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:
If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
To him that did but yesterday suspire,
There was not such a gracious creature born.
But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
And chase the native beauty from his cheek
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,
And so he 'l die; and, rising so again,
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
I shall not know him: therefore, never, never,
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.

 He talks to me that never had a son.

 Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?
Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,
I could give better comfort than you do.
I will not keep this form upon my head,
When there is such disorder in my wit.
O Lord I my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
My life, my joy, my food, my all the world
My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' curel

 Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
I will not be your friend nor enemy:
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
And as I find her, so am I affected.
Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;
Her father will be angry.

     Peace!

      Indeed!

              We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,

We do not act that often jest and laugh;
'Tis old, but true, Still swine eats all the draff.

Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants.
        Within a quarter of an hour.

 There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.

 That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song: upon their sight,
We two in great amazedness will fly:
Then let them all encircle him about
And, fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight,
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.

 The truth being known,
We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
And mock him home to Windsor.

 My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
Finely attired in a robe of white.

 Fear not you that. Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies.

 Go, Mistress Ford,
Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
[Exit Mrs. Ford.
I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will.
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
And he my husband best of all affects.
The doctor is well money'd and his friends
Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.
[Exit. 
     Against such lewdsters and their lechery
Those that betray them do no treachery.

 Alas, what noise?

 I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher.
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town?

  A puffed man?

    Why went you not with master doctor, maid?

 Well, I will must no further, Master Fenton,
Heaven give you many, many merry days!
Good husband, let us every one go home,
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;

You moonshine revellers, and shades of night,
You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
Attend your office and your quality.
Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.

 About, about;
Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower:
Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue, and white;
Like sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.

 With trial-fire touch me his fingerend:
If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

 Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.

SONG.

Fie on sinful fantasy!
Fie on lust and luxury!
Lust is but a bloody fire,
Kindled with unchaste desire.
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
Pinch him for his villany;
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.

During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS comes one way, and steals away a boy in green; SLENDER another
way, and takes off a boy in white; and
FENTON comes, and steals away MRS
ANNE PAGE. A noise of hunting is
heard within. All the Fairies run away.
FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head, and rises.
   Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD.
Fie on sinful fantasy!
Fie on lust and luxury!
Lust is but a bloody fire,
Kindled with unchaste desire.
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
Pinch him for his villany;
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out."
36,her.,HERMIA,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-her.," So is Lysander.

 I would my father look'd but with my eyes.

 I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty,
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

 So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

 Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

 O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.

 O spite! too old to be engaged to young.

 O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.

 If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross,
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.

 My good Lysander!
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.

 God speed, fair Helena! whither away?

 I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

 I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

 The more I hate, the more he follows me.

 His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

 Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see,
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!

 And in the wood, where often you and I
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Farewell, sweet playfellow; pray thou for us;
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
Keep word, Lysander; we must starve our sight
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.

 Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
For I upon this bank will rest my head.

 Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.

 Lysander riddles very prettily:
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
Lie further off; in human modesty,
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!

 With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
                          [They sleep. 
Enter PUCK.
 Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.
Lysander! what, removed?   Lysander! lord!
What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
Alack, where are you? speak, an if you hear;
Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
No? then I well perceive you are not nigh:
Either death or you I'll find immediately.
                                     [Exit
 Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
And kill me too.
The sun was not so true unto the day
As he to me: would he have stolen away
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
May through the centre creep and so displease
Her brother's noontide with the Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.

 What's this to my Lysander? where is he
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

 Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
Of maiden's patience.   Hast thou slain him, then?
Henceforth be never number'd among men!
O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.

 I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.

 A privilege never to see me more.
And from thy hated presence part I so:
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
                                 [Exit.
 Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
It pays the hearing double recompense.
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

 What love could press Lysander from my side?

 You speak not as you think; it cannot be.

 I am amazed at your passionate words.
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.

 I understand not what you mean by this.

 Sweet, do not scorn her so.

 Lysander, whereto tends all this?

 Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
Sweet love,--

 Do you not jest?

 What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left me:
Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
In earnest, shall I say?

 O me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!
You thief of love! what, have you come by night
And stolen my love's heart from him?

 Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
And with her personage, her tall personage,
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
And are you grown so high in his esteem;
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
How low am I, thou painted Maypole? speak;
How low am I? I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

 Lower! hark, again.

 Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?

 What, with Lysander?

 'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her.

 You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
Nay, go not back.

 I am amazed, and know not what to say.
                         [Exit. 
 Never so weary, never so in woe,
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
I can no further crawl, no further go;
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
                      [Lies down and sleeps.
 Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
When every thing seems double.

 Yea; and my father.

"
37,hel.,HELENA,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-hel.," Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching: O, were favor so,
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.

 O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!

 O that my prayers could such affection move!

 The more I love, the more he hateth me.

 None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!

 How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities:
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured every where:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.
                                    [Exit. You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
And I shall have no power to follow you.

 And even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
What worser place can I beg in your love,--
And yet a place of high respect with me,--
Than to be used as you use your dog?

 And I am sick when I look not on you.

 Your virtue is my privilege; for that
It is not night when I do see your face,
Therefore I think I am not in the night;
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
For you in my respect are all the world:
Then how can it be said I am alone,
When all the world is here to look on me?

 The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
When cowardice pursues and valor flies.

 Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
We should be woo'd and were not made to woo.
                     [Exit Dem. 
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
To die upon the hand I love so well.
                     [Exit.
 Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.

 O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.

 O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
For she hath blesssed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright?   Not with salt tears:
If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.

 Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.

 Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
That I did never, no, nor never can,
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
But you must flout my insufficiency?
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
In such disdainful manner me to woo.
But fare you well: perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
O, that a lady, of one man refused,
Should of another therefore be abused!
                            [Exit.
 You do advance your cunning more and more.
When truth kills truth, O devilish holy fray!
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.

 Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.

 O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
To set against me for your merriment:
If you were civil and knew courtesy,
You would not do me thus much injury.
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
But you must join in souls to mock me too?
If you were men, as men you are in show,
You would not use a gentle lady so;
To vow and swear and superpraise my parts,
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
With your derision! none of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin, and extort
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.

 Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

 Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
Have with our needles created both one flower,
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
Had been incorporate. So we grew together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
But yet an union in partition;
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury.

 Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius,
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
Precious, celestial?   Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
What though I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
But miserable most, to love unloved?
This you should pity rather than despise.

 Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
You would not make me such an argument.
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.

 O excellent!

 Yes, sooth; and so do you.

 Fine, i'faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!

 I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
I am a right maid for my cowardice:
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
Because she is something lower than myself,
That I can match her.

 Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
I evermore did love you, Hermia,
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back
And follow you no further: let me go:
You see how simple and how fond I am.

 A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.

 With Demetrius.

 O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
She was a vixen when she went to school;
And though she be but little, she is fierce.

 I will not trust you, I,
Nor longer stay in your curst company.
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
My legs are longer though, to run away.[Exit.

 O weary night, O long and tedious night,
Abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east,
That I may back to Athens by daylight,
From these that my poor company detest:
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
Steal me awhile from mine own company.
                     [Lies down and sleeps.
 So methinks:
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
Mine own, and not mine own.
 And Hippolyta.

"
38,tita.,TITANIA,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-tita.," What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
I have forsworn his bed and company.

 Then I must be thy lady: but I know
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
Come from the farthest steppe of India?
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity.

 These are the forgeries of jealousy:
And never, since the middle summer's spring,
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
Or in the beached margent of the sea,
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
Have every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents:
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
The human mortals want their winter here;
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
That rheumatic diseases do abound:
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
The childing autumn, angry winter, change
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which:
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate, from our dissension;
We are their parents and original.

 Set your heart at rest:
The fairy land buys not the child of me.
His mother was a votaress of my order:
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
To fetch me trifles, and return again,
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
And for her sake I will not part with him.

 Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
If you will patiently dance in our round
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.

 Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
            [Exit Titania with her train.
 Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
Then to your offices and let me rest.
          The Fairies sing.
You spotted snakes with double tongue,
   Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
   Come not near our fairy queen.
   Philomel, with melody
   Sing in our sweet lullaby;
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
   Never harm,
   Nor spell nor charm,
 Come our lovely lady nigh;
 So, good night, with lullaby.
Weaving spiders, conme not here;
 Hence, kyou long-legg'd spinners, hence!
Beetles black, approach not near;
 Worm nor snail, do no offence.
   Philomel, with melody, &c.

 What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?

 I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.

 Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

 Out of this wood do not desire to go:
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
I am a spirit of no common rate;
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep.
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED.
 Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
With purple grapes, green figs and mulberries;
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
To have my love to bed and to arise;
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.

 Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
Lamenting some enforced chastity.
Tie up my love's tongue, bring him silently.
                                 [Exeunt.
 Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
And stick musk-roses in thy sleek, smooth head,
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.

 What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?

 Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.

 I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.

 Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away.
                       [Exeunt fairies.
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
Gentle entwist; the female ivy so
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.

  Enter PUCK. My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.

 How came these things to pass?
O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!

 Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
[Music, still. 
 Come, my lord, and in our flight
     Tell me how it came this night
     That I sleeping here was found
    With these mortals on the ground.

To each word a warbling note:

"
39,des.,DESDEMONA,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-des.," My noble father,
I do perceive here a divided duty:
To you I am bound for life and education;
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
And so much duty as my mother show'd
To you, preferring you before her father,
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord.

 Nor I; I would not there reside,
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
And let me find a charter in your voice,
To assist my simpleness.

 That I did love the Moor to live with him,
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord:
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
And to his honors and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

 I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

 O, but I fear--How lost you company?

 Alas, she has no speech.

 O, fie upon thee, slanderer!

 What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?

 Come on, assay. There's one gone to the harbor?

 I am not merry; but I do beguile
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

 Well praised! How if she be black and witty?

 Worse and worse.

   To do what?

  Let's meet him and receive him.

 My dear Othello!

 The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase,
Even as our days do grow!

 What's the matter?

 Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf.

 O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.

 I know't; I thank you.   You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a politic distance.

 Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him   tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle every thing he does
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.

 Why, stay, and hear me speak.

 Well, do your discretion.
Exit Cassio.
Enter OTHELLO and IAGO.
 How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here,
A man that languishes in your displeasure.

 Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
If I have any grace or power to move you,
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgement in an honest face:
I prithee, call him back.

 Ay, sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me,
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

 But shall 't be shortly?

 Shall't be to-night at supper?

 To-morrow dinner, then?

 Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
Out of their best--is not almost a fault
To incur a private check. When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--

 Why, this is not a boon;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted.

 Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

 Emilia, come.   Be as your fancies teach you;
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.
 How now, my dear Othello!
Your dinner, and the generous islanders
By you invited, do attend your presence.

 Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?

 'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
It will be well.

 I am very sorry that you are not well.
Exeunt Othello and Desdemona.
  Why, man?

 Go to: where lodges he?

 Can any thing be made of this?

   Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

 Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are, it were enough
To put him to ill thinking.

 Who, he?   I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him.

 I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be call'd to him.
Enter OTHELLO.
How is't with you, my lord?

 Well, my good lord.

 It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

 You may, indeed, say so;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

 I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

 I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

 Here, my lord.

 I have it not about me.

 No, indeed, my lord.

 Is't possible?

 Indeed! is't true?

 Then would to God that I had never seen 't!

 Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

 Heaven bless us!

 It is not lost; but what an if it were?

 I say, it is not lost.

 Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit:
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

 Come, come;
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

 I pray, talk me of Cassio.

 A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
Shared dangers with you,--

 In sooth, you are to blame.

 I ne'er saw this before.
Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

 How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?

 Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

 I prithee, do so.
Exit Iago.Something, sure, of state,
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practice
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
Though great ones are their object.   'Tis even so;
For let our finger ache, and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
Nor of them look for such observances
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much. Emilia,
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
And he's indicted falsely.

 Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

 Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

 I will go seek him.   Cassio, walk here about:
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

 And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

 Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

 My lord? A most unhappy one: I would do much
To atone them, for the love I bear Cassio.

 My lord?

 What, is he angry?

 Trust me, I am glad on't.

 My lord?

 Why, sweet Othello,-- I have not deserved this.

 I will not stay to offend you.
Going.
 My lord?

 My lord, what is your will?

 What is your pleasure?

 What horrible fancy's this? Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words,
But not the words.

 Your wife, my lord; your true
And loyal wife.

 Heaven doth truly know it.

 To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

 Alas the heavy day!   Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me: if you have lost him,
Why, I have lost him too.

 I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

 Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

 By heaven, you do me wrong.

 No, as I am a Christian:
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
>From any other foul unlawful touch

Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

 No, as I shall be saved.

 O, heaven forgive us!

 Faith, half asleep.

 With who?

 Who is thy lord?

 I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
But what should go by water.   Prithee, tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
And call thy husband hither.

 'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO.
 I cannot tell.   Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.

 Am I that name, Iago?

 Such as she says my lord did say I was.

 I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

 It is my wretched fortune.

 Nay, heaven doth know.

 If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

 O good Iago,
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Delighted them in any other form;
Or that I do not yet, and ever did,
And ever will--though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement:--love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me!   Unkindness may do much;
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love.   I cannot say 'whore:'
It doth abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

 If 'twere no other,--

 Your honour is most welcome.

 My lord?

 I will, my lord.
Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and Attendants.
 He says he will return incontinent:
He hath commanded me to go to bed,
And bade me to dismiss you.

 It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
We must not now displease him.

 So would not I: my love doth so approve him,
That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns,--
Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.

 All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me
In one of those same sheets.

 My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
And she died singing it: that song to-night
Will not go from   my mind; I have much to do,
But to go hang my head all at one side,
And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.

 No, unpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.

 He speaks well.

 The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
Sing all a green willow;
Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
Sing willow, willow, willow:
The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
Sing willow, willow, willow;
Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;
Lay by these:--
Singing
Sing willow, willow, willow;
Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--
Singing
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,--
Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?

 I call'd my love false love; but what said he then?
Sing willow, willow, willow:
If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men.--
So, get thee gone; good night.   Mine eyes do itch;
Doth that bode weeping?

 I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind?

 Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

 No, by this heavenly light!

 Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

 In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

 Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world.

 I do not think there is any such woman.

 Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
Exeunt, Who's there? Othello?

 Will you come to bed, my lord?

 Ay, my lord.

 Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

 Talk you of killing?

 Then heaven
Have mercy on me!

 If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

 And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

 They are loves I bear to you.

 That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope,
They do not point on me.

 I will so. What's the matter?

 No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man, and ask him.

 Ay, but not yet to die.

 Then Lord have mercy on me!

 And have you mercy too!   I never did
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love; I never gave him token.

 He found it then;
I never gave it him: send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.

 What, my lord?

 How? unlawfully?

 He will not say so.

 O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

 Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

 O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

 Kill me to-morrow: let me live tonight!

 But half an hour!

 But while I say one prayer!

 O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

 A guiltless death I die.

 Nobody; I myself.   Farewell:
Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!
Dies.
"
40,emil.,EMILIA,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-emil.," You have little cause to say so.

 You shall not write my praise.

 How if fair and foolish?

 Good morrow, good lieutenant: I am sorry
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it;
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you, but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again.

 Pray you, come in:
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom   freely.

 Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
As if the case were his.

 Madam, here comes my lord.

 I am glad I have found this napkin:
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
And give't Iago: what he will do with it
Heaven knows, not I;
I nothing but to please his fantasy.
Re-enter IAGO.
 Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

 Ha!

 O, is that all?   What will you give me now
For that same handkerchief?

 What handkerchief!
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
That which so often you did bid me steal.

 No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence,
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took 't up.
Look, here it is.

 What will you do with't, that you have been so earnest
To have me filch it? If it be not for some purpose of import,
Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
When she shall lack it.

 I know not, madam.

 Is he not jealous?

 Look, where he comes.

 Is not this man jealous?

 'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
They eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
They belch us.   Look you, Cassio and my husband!
Enter CAsslo and IAGO.
 He went hence but now,
And certainly in strange unquietness.

 Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you.

 But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.

 Lady, amen.

 Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

 But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

 Never, my lord.

 Never.

 Never, my lord.

 I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.

 Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

 Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

 Why, with my lord, madam.

 He that is yours, sweet lady.

 Here's a change indeed!
Exit.
 Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
As true hearts cannot bear.

 He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callet.

 Hath   she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

 I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

 A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!

 O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

 How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.

 Dismiss me!

 I would you had never seen him!

 I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

 Come, come, you talk.

 Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

 A very handsome man.

  It's the wind. 'Tis neither here nor there.

 There be some such, no question.

 Why, would not you?

 Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
I might do't as well i' the dark.

 The world's a huge thing: it is a great price
For a small vice.

   Yes, a dozen; and as many to the
Vantage as would store the world they played for.
But I do think it is their husbands' faults
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
Or scant our former having in despite;
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Yet have we some revenge.   Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others?   Is it sport?
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
I think it doth: is 't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too: and have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well: else let them know,
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

 'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

 Alas, good gentlemen alas, good Cassio!

 Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

 As I! foh! fie upon thee!

 My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!

 What, ho! my lord, my lord!

 O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!

 I do beseech you
That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!

 O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

 But now, my lord.

 Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
Call'd Roderigo.

 No, Cassio is not kill'd.

 Alas, what cry is that?

 Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
Help! help, ho! help!   O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona!   O sweet mistress, speak!

 O, who hath done this deed?

 Alas, who knows?

 She said so: I must needs report the truth.

 O, the more angel she,
And you the blacker devil!

 Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

 Thou art rash as fire, to say
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

 My husband!

 That she was false to wedlock?

 My husband!

 My husband!

 O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love!
My husband say that she was false!

 If he say so, may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

 Do thy worst:
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her.

 Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
I care not for thy sword: I'll make thee known,
Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress!   Murder! murder!
Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others.
 O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
That men must lay their murders on your neck.

 Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
Speak, for my heart is full.

 But did you ever tell him she was false?

 You told a lie; an odious, damned lie;
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
She false with Cassio!--did   you say with Cassio?

 I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--

 And your reports have set the murder on.

 Villany, villany, villany!
I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--
I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
O villany. villany!

 Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

 Nay, lay thee down and roar;
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
That e'er did lift up eye. O heaven! O heavenly powers!

 'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

 I will not.
Iago offers to stab Emilia.
 O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
I found by fortune and did give my husband;
For often, with a solemn earnestness,
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
He begg'd of me to steal it.

 She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
And I did give't my husband.

 By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
Do with so good a woman?

 Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

 What did thy song bode, lady.
Hark, canst thou hear me?   I will play the swan,
And die in music. Singing
Willow, willow, willow.--
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
Dies.
"
41,abb.,"MILIA, wife to geon",Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-abb.," Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

 How long hath this possession held the man?

 Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
Buried some dear friend?   Hath not else his eye
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

 You should for that have reprehended him.

 Ay, but not rough enough.

 Haply, in private.

 Ay, but not enough.

 And thereof came it that the man was mad:
The venom clamors of a jealous woman
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
And thereof comes it that his head is light.
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
Thou say'st his sports were hinder'd by thy brawls:
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
But moody and dull melancholy,
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

 No, not a creature enters in my house.

 Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
And it shall privilege him from your hands
Till I have brought him to his wits again,
Or lose my labor in assaying it.

 Be patient; for I will not let him stir
Till I have used the approved means I have,
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
To make of him a formal man again:
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
A charitable duty of my order.
Therefore depart and leave him here with me,

 Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.
[Exit. 
 Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
[All gather to see them. 
 Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
And gain a husband by his liberty.
Speak, old Ægeon, if thou be'st the man
That hadst a wife once call'd Æmilia
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
O, if thou be'st the same Ægeon, speak,
And speak unto the same Æmilia!

 By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
What then became of them I cannot tell;
I to this fortune that you see me in.

 Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
And all that are assembled in this place,
That by this sympathized one day's error
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
And we shall make full satisfaction.
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
My heavy burthen ne'er delivered.
The duke, my husband and my children both,
And you the calendars of their nativity,
Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
After so long grief, such festivity!

42,adr.,ADRIANA,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-adr.," Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

 Why should their liberty than ours be more ?

 Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

 There's none but asses will be bridled so.

 This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

 But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

 How if your husband start some other where?

 Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
They can be meek that have no other cause.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
But were we burden'd with like weight of pain,
As much or more we should ourselves complain:
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me;
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

 Say, is your tardy master now at hand ?

 Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?

  Horn-mad, thou villain!

 Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

 Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

 Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

 His company must do his minions grace,
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
What ruins are in me that can be found,
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair:
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

 Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
Would that alone, alone he would detain,
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
That others touch, and often touching will
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

 Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear,
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
That, undividable, incorporate,
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
And take unmingled thence that drop again,
Without addition or diminishing,
As take from me thyself and not me too.
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
For if we too be one and thou play false,
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
I live unstain'd, thou undishonored.

 By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.

 How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

 Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
To put the finger in the eye and weep,
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.

 Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

 Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?

 Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.

 Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
What observation madest thou in this case
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?

 He meant he did me none; the more my spite.

 And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

 And what said he?

 With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

 Didst speak him fair?

 I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

 Ah, but I think him better than I say,
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
         Enter DROMIO of Syracuse.
 Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?

 Why, man, what is the matter?

 What, is he arrested?   Tell me at whose suit.

 Go fetch it, sister.   Exit Luciana.
This I wonder at,

That he, unknown to me, should be in debt,
Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

 What, the chain?

 The hours come back! that did I never hear.

 As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!

 Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight,
And bring thy master home immediately.
Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
Conceit, my comfort and my injury.
[Exeunt. His incivility confirms no less.
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
Establish him in his true sense again,
And I will please you what you will demand.

 O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!

 O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
Where would you had remain'd until this time,
Free from these slanders and this open shame!

 Is't good to soothe him in these contraries ?

 Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

 He came to me and I deliver'd it.

 I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

 Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.

 O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.

 What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer ?
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

 I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

 Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
[Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan.
Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?

 I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

  He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.

 It may be so, but I did never see it.
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
I long to know the truth hereof at large.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier
drawn, and DROMIO of Syracuse. 
 And come with naked swords.
Let's call more help to have them bound again.

 Hold, hurt him not, for God's sakel he is mad.
Some get within him, take his sword away:
Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

 To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
And bear him home for his recovery.

 This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
And much different from the man he was;
But till this afternoon his passion
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

 To none of these, except it be the last;
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

 Why, so I did.

 As roughly as my modesty would let me.

 And in assemblies too.

 It was the copy of our conference:
In bed he slept not for my urging it;
At board he fed not for my urging it;
Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
In company I often glanced it;
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

 She did betray me to my own reproof.
Good people, enter and lay hold on him.

 Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

 I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
And will have no attorney but myself;
And therefore let me have him home with me.

 I will not hence and leave my husband here:
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
To separate the husband and the wife.

 Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
And never rise until my tears and prayers
Have won his grace to come in person hither
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

 Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!

 May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
At your important letters,--this ill day
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
That desperately he hurried through the street,
With him his bondman, all as mad as he,--
Doing displeasure to the citizens
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
That here and there his fury had committed.
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
He broke from those that had the guard of him;
And with his mad attendant and himself,
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
Met us again and madly bent on us,
Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
We came again to bind them. Then they fled
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

 Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
And that is false thou dost report to us.

 Ay me, it is my husband!   Witness you,
That he is borne about invisible:
Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus.
 No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
As this is false he burdens me withal!

 I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

 Which of you two did dine with me to-day ?

 And are not you my husband?

 I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

"
43,luc.,LUCIANA,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/err.xml-luc.," Perhaps some merchant hath invited him
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
A man is master of his liberty:
Time is their master, and, when they see time,
They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.

 Because their business still lies out o' door.

 O, know he is the bridle of your will.

 Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls
Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
Are masters to their females, and their lords:
Then let your will attend on their accords.

 Not this, but troubles of the marriagebed.

 Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

 Till he come home again, I would forbear.

 Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
           Enter DROMIO of Ephesus.
  Quoth who?

 Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

 Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!

 How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
[Exeunt.  Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
When were you wont to use my sister thus?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.

 Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

 Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

 If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.

 Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.
[Exeunt.  And may it be that you have quite forgot
A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
And let her read it in thy looks at board:
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
Being compact of credit, that you love us;
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
We in your motion turn and you may move us.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

 What, are you mad, that you do reason so ?

 It is a fault that springeth from your eye.

 Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.

 Why call you me love? call my sister so.

 That's my sister.

 All this my sister is, or else should be.

 O, soft, sir! hold you still:
I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.
[Exit. 
         Enter DROMIO of Syracuse.
 First he denied you had in him no right.

 Then swore he that he was a stranger here.

 Then pleaded I for you.

 That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.

 With words that in an honest suit might move.
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.

 Have patience, I beseech.

 Who would be jealous then of such a one?
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

 How hast thou lost thy breath?

 Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!

 And I am witness with her that she did.

 Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!

 God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!

 God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.

 She never reprehended him but mildly.
When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?

 Complain unto the duke of this indignity.

 Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.
Enter DUKE, attended; ÆGEON bareheaded;
with the Headsman and other Officers. 
 Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
But she tells to your highness simple truth!

"
44,her.,HERMIONE,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-her.," I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
All in Bohemia's well: this satisfaction
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
He's beat from his best ward.

 To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
But let him say so then, and let him go;
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
To let him there a month behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

 Nay, but you will?

 Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I,
Though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths,
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
One of them you shall be.

 Not your gaoler, then,
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
You were pretty lordings then?

 Was not my lord
The verier wag o' the two?

 By this we gather
You have tripp'd since.

 Grace to boot!
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
With any but with us.

 He'll stay, my lord.

 Never?

 What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With spur we heat an acre. But to the goal:
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
What was my first? it has an elder sister,
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Nay, let me have't; I long.

 'Tis grace indeed.
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
The other for some while a friend.

 He something seems unsettled.

 You lookAs if you held a brow of much distraction:
Are you moved, my lord?

 If you would seek us
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there ?

 Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
'Tis past enduring.

 What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
And tell's a tale.

 As merry as you will.

 Let's have that, good sir.
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

 Nay, come, sit down; then on.

 Come on, then,And give't me in mine ear.
Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords, and others.
 What is this? sport?

 But I'ld say he had not,
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

 Should a villain say so,
The most replenish'd villain in the world,
He were as much more villain: you, my lord
Do but mistake.

 No, by my life,
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
When you shall come to clearer knowledge that
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake.

 There's some ill planet reigns:
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favorable.   Good my lords,
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honorable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
The king's will be perform'd!

 Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
My women may be with me; for you see
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
As I come out: this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.

 Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part no other
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
Behold our human actions, as they do,
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
Who least will seem to do so, my past life
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
As I am now unhappy; which is more
Than history can pattern, though devised
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
To prate and talk for life and honor 'fore
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honor,
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
And only that I stand for. I appeal
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
How merited to be so; since he came,
With what encounter so uncurrent I
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of honor, or in act or will
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
Cry fie upon my grave!

 That's true enough;
Though 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

 More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
With whom I am accused, I do confess
I loved him as in honor he required,
With such a kind of love as might become
A lady like me, with a love even such,
So and no other, as yourself commanded:
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
For me to try how: all I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man;
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

 Sir,
You speak a language that I understand not:
My life stands in the level of your dreams,
Which I'll lay down.

 Sir, spare your threats:
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
But know not how it went. My second joy
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
I am barr'd, like one infectious.   My third comfort,
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
Haled out to murder: myself on every post
Proclaim'd a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
Here to this place, i' the open air, before
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
That I should fear to die?   Therefore proceed.
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honor,
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honors all,
I do refer me to the oracle:
Apollo be my judge!

 The Emperor of Russia was my father:
O that he were alive, and here beholding
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
Of pity, not revenge!
 Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION.
 Praised!

 You gods, look down
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own,
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
Myself to see the issue.

"
45,per.,PERDITA,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-per.," Sir, my gracious lord,
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom, I should blush
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
To show myself a glass.

 Now Jove afford you cause!
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
To think your father, by some accident,
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
How would he look, to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up? What would he say?   Or how
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
The sternness of his presence?

 O, but, sir,
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
One of these two must be necessities,
Which then will speak, that you must change this purpose,
Or I my life.

 O lady Fortune,
Stand you auspicious!

  [To Pol.] Sir, welcome:
It is my father's will I should take on me
The hostess-ship o' the day.[To Cam.] You're welcome, sir.
Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
Seeming and savor all the winter long:
Grace and remembrance be to you both,
And welcome to our shearing!

 Sir, the year growing ancient,
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
Of trembling winter, the fairest flowers o' the season
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
To get slips of them.

 For I have heard it said
There is an art which in their piedness shares
With great creating nature.

 So it is.

 I'll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than were I painted I would wish
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram;
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Of middle summer, and I think they are given
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.

 Out, alas!
You'ld be so lean, that blasts of January
Would blow you through and through. Now, my fair'st friend,
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
That come before the swallow dares, and take
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses,
That die unmarried, ere they can behold
Bright Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Most incident to maids: bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
To strew him o'er and o'er!

 No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition.

 O Doricles,
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
Do plainly give you an unstain'd shepherd,
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
You woo'd me the false way.

 I'll swear for 'em.

  Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
Perfume for a lady's chamber;
Golden quoifs and stomachers,
For my lads to give their dears:
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
What maids lack from head to heel:
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
Buy, lads, or else your lasses cry:Come buy.

 I cannot speak
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his.

 Even here undone!
I was not much afeard; for once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone ?
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
But milk my ewes and weep.

 How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often said, my dignity would last
But till 'twere known!

 One of these is true:
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
But not take in the mind.

 Your pardon, sir; for this
I'll blush you thanks.

 Happy be you!
All that you speak shows fair.

 I see the play so lies
That I must bear a part.

 O my poor father!
The heaven spies upon us, will not have
Our contract celebrated.

 And give me leave,
And do not say 'tis superstition, that
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

 So long could I
Stand by a looker on.

Let him have knowledge who I am.
[Exit Gent.Good lady,
No court in Europe is too good for thee;
What dost thou then in prison?
    Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler.Now, good sir,
You know me, do you not?

 Pray you then,
Conduct me to the queen.

 Here's ado,To lock up honesty and honor from
The access of gentle visitors! Is't lawful, pray you,
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?

 I pray now, call her.
Withdraw yourselves.
[Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants.
 Well, be't so, prithee. [Exit Gaoler.
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
As passes coloring.
 Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA.Dear gentlewoman,
How fares our gracious lady?

 A boy?

 I dare be sworn:
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king, beshrew them!
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
If I prove honey-mouth'd, let my tongue blister
And never to my red-look'd anger be
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
Commend my best obedience to the queen:
If she dares trust me with her little babe,
I'll show't the king and undertake to be
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails.

 Tell her, Emilia,
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from my bosom, let't not be doubted
I shall do good.

 You need not fear it, sir:
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
By law and process of great nature thence
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
The anger of the king nor guilty of,
If any be, the trespass of the queen.

 Do not you fear: upon mine honor, I
Will stand betwixt you and danger.
[Exeunt. Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
More free than he is jealous.

 Not so hot, good sir:
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
At each his needless heavings, such as you
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
Do come with words as medicinal as true,
Honest as either, to purge him of that humor
That presses him from sleep.

 No noise, my lord; but needful conference
About some gossips for your highness.

 From all dishonesty he can: in this,
Unless he take the course that you have done,
Commit me for committing honor, trust it,
He shall not rule me.

 Good my liege, I come;
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
Less appear so in comforting your evils,
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
From your good queen.

 Good queen, my lord,
Good queen; I say good queen;
And would by combat make her good, so were I
A man, the worst about you.

 Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
[Laying down the child.
 Not so:
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me, and no less honest
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
As this world goes, to pass for honest.

 For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upon't!

 So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld call your children yours.

 Nor I, nor any
But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
The sacred honor of himself, his queen's,
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's; and will not--
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
The root of his opinion, which is rotten
As ever oak or stone was sound.

 It is yours;
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
Although the print be little, the whole matter
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,His smiles,
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
So like to him that got it, if thou hast
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colors
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does.
Her children not her husband's!

 A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Can do no more.

 I care not:
It is an heretic that makes the fire,
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
But this most cruel usage of your queen,
Not able to produce more accusation
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savors
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
Yea, scandalous to the world.

 I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours: Jove send her
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
Will never do him good, not one of you.
So, so: farewell; we are gone.
[Exit. 
 This news is mortal to the queen: look down
And see what death is doing.

 Woe the while!
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
Break too!

 What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive, whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies,
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polixenes, 'twas nothing;
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honor,
To have him kill a king; poor trespasses,
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
To be or none or little; though a devil
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
Of the young prince, whose honorable thoughts,
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
When I have said, cry 'woe!'--the queen, the queen,
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead, and vengeance for't
Not dropp'd down yet.

 I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir: therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
Upon a barren mountain, and still winter
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert.

 I am sorry for't:
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you, rather
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
Of what you should forget.   Now, good my liege,
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
I'll not remember you of my own lord,
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
And I'll say nothing.

 True, too true, my lord:
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
Or from the all that are took something good,
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
Would be unparallel'd.

 You are one of those
Would have him wed again.

 There is none worthy,
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
For has not the divine Apollo said,
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
That King Leontes shall not have an heir
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come again to me; who, on my life,
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
Oppose against their wills. [To Leontes.] Care not for issue;
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
Was like to be the best.

 And left them
More rich for what they yielded.

 Had she such power,
She had just cause.

 I should so.
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
Should be 'Remember mine.'

 Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave?

 Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

 Unless another,
As like Hermione as is her picture,
Affronts his eye.

 I have done.
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
As was your former; but she shall be such
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost, it should take joy
To see her in your arms.

 That
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
Never till then.
               Enter a Gentleman.
 O Hermione,
As every present time doth boast itself
Above a better gone, so must thy grave
Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
Have said and writ so, but your writing now
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
To say you have seen a better.

 How! not women?

 Had our prince,
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
Well with this lord: there was not full a month
Between their births.

 Sir, my liege,
Your eye hath too much youth in't; not a month
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
Than what you look on now.

 What, sovereign, sir,
I did not well I meant well. All my services
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
It is a surplus of your grace, which never
My life may last to answer.

 As she lived peerless,
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
[Paulina draws a curtain, and discovers Hermione standing like a statue.
I like your silence, it the more shows off
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege.
Comes it not something near?

 So much the more our carver's excellence;
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
As she lived now.

 O, patience!
The statue is but newly fix'd, the color's
Not dry.

 Indeed, my lord,
If I had thought the sight of my poor image
Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
I'ld not have show'd it.

 No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
May think anon it moves.

 I'll draw the curtain:
My lord's almost so far transported that
He'll think anon it lives.

 I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
I could afflict you farther.

 Good my lord, forbear:
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

 Either forbear,
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
For more amazement. If you can behold it,
I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
And take you by the hand: but then you'll think--
Which I protest against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.

 It is required
You do awake your faith.   Then all stand still;
On: those that think it unlawful business
I am about, let them depart.

 Music, awake her; strike! [Music.
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:[Hermione comes down.
Start not; her actions shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
Until you see her die again; for then
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
Is she become the suitor?

 That she is living,
Were it but told you, should be hooted at
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
Though yet she speak not.   Mark a little while.
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
Our Perdita is found.

 There's time enough for that;
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Your joys with like relation. Go together,
You precious winners all; your exultation
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
Will wing me some wither'd bough and there
My mate, that's never to be found again,
Lament till I am lost.

"
47,isab.,ISABELLA,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-isab.," And have you nuns no farther privileges?

 Yes, truly: I speak not as desiring more;
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

 Who's that which calls?

 Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls?
                  Enter Lucio.
 Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister.

 Woe me! for what?

 Sir, make me not your story.

 You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

 Some one with child by him?   My cousin Juliet?

 Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.

 O, let him marry her.

 Doth he so seek his life?

 Alas! What poor ability's in me
To do him good?

 My power?   Alas, I doubt--

 I'll see what I can do.

 I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.

 Good sir, adieu.

[Exeunt.
 I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
Please but your honour hear me.

 There is a vice that most I do abhor,
And most desire should meet the blow   of justice;
For which I would not plead, but that I must;
For which I must not plead, but that I am
At war 'twixt will and will not.

 I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
And not my brother.

 O just but severe law!
I had a brother, then.  Heaven keep your honour!

 Must he needs die?

 Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

 But can you, if you would?

 But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
As mine is to him?

 Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word,
May call it back again. Well, believe this,
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does.
If he had been as you and you as he,
You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
Would not have been so stern.

 I would to heaven I had your potency,
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
And what a prisoner.

 Alas, alas!
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be,
If He, which is the top of judgement, should
But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
And mercy then will breathe within your lips
Like man new made.

 To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.

 Yet show some pity.

 So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
And he, that suffers. O, it is excellent
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.

 Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
For every pelting, petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
Drest in a little brief authority,
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
Would all themselves laugh mortal.

 We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
But in the less foul profanation.

 That in the captain's but a choleric word,
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

 Because authority, though it err like others,
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
Against my brother's life.

 Gentle my lord, turn back.

 Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

 Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

 Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal.

 Heaven keep your honour safe!

 At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your worship?

 'Save your honour!

[Exeunt Isabella, Luclo, and Provost.
 I am come to know your pleasure.

 Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

 Under your sentence?

 When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not.

 'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

 Sir, believe this,
I had rather give my body than my soul.

 How say you?

 Please you to do't.
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
It is no sin at all, but charity.

 That I do beg his life if it be sin,
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
To have it added to the faults of mine,
And nothing of your answer.

 Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
But graciously to know I am no better.

 So.

 True.

 As much for my poor brother as myself:
That is, were I under the terms of death,
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
And strip myself to death, as to a bed
That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld
My body up to shame.

 And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once,
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
Should die for ever.

 Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

 O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
I something do excuse the thing I hate,
For his advantage that I dearly love,

 Else let my brother die,
If not a feodary, but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness.

 Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women!   Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
For we are soft as our complexions are,
And credulous to false prints.

 I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
Let me entreat you speak the former language.

 My brother did love Juliet,
And you tell me that he shall die for it.

 I know your virtue hath a license in't,
Which seems a little fouler than it is,
To pluck on others.

 Ha! little honour to be much believed,
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
What man thou art.

 To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
Either of condemnation or approof;
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will;
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood,
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour,
That, had he twenty heads to tender down
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
Before his sister should her body stoop
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest
[Exit
 What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!

 My business is a word or two with Claudio.

 Why,
As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
Intends you for his swift ambassador,
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.

 None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
To cleave a heart in twain.

 Yes, brother, you may live:
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
But fetter you till death.

 Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
Though all the world's vastidity you had,
To a determined scope.

 In such a one as, you consenting to't,
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
And leave you naked.

 O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
And six or seven winters more respect
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies.

 There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances.   This outward-sainted deputy,
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;
His filth within being cast, he would appear
A pond as deep as hell.

 O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
The damned'st body to invest and cover
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
If I would yield him my virginity,
Thou mightst be freed.

 Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
So to offend him still. This night's the time
That I should do what I abhor to name,
Or else thou diest to-morrow.

 O, were it but my life,
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
As frankly as a pin.

 Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

 Which is the least?

 What says my brother?

 And shamed life a hateful.

 Alas, alas!

 O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretchl
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die, perish! Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
No word to save thee.

 O, fie, fie, fie!
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.

 What is your will?

          He hath a garden circummured with brick,
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
That makes his opening with this bigger key:
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him.

 I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
With whispering and most guilty diligence,
In action all of precept, he did show me
The way twice o'er.

 No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
Can be but brief; for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along,
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
I come about my brother.

 I do desire the like.

 She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
If you advise it.

 Little have you to say
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
'Remember now my brother.'

 Peace, ho, be here!

 Ho, by your leave!

 The better, given me by so holy a man.
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

 Nay, but it is not so.

 O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

 Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

 I am directed by you.

 To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
He says, to veil full purpose.

 Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
That's bitter to sweet end.

 O, peace! the friar is come,
              Enter FRIAR PETER.
 Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

 O worthy duke,
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must either punish me, not being believed,
Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

 By course of justice!

 Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer; is't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
Is it not strange and strange?

 It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
To the end of reckoning.

 O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
There is another comfort than this world,
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
That I am touch'd with madness!  Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
Had I more name for badness.

 O gracious duke,
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
And hide the false seems true.

 I am the sister of one Claudio,
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo;
I, in probation of a sisterhood,
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
As then the messenger,--

 That's he indeed.

 This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

 I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

 Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.

 In brief, to set the needless process by,
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
For my poor brother's head.

 O, that it were as like as it is true!

 And is this all?
Then, O you blessed ministers above,
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
Unfold the evil which is here wrap't up
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

 One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

 O, give me pardon,
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
Your unknown sovereignty

 I do, my lord.
Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER,
                 and PROVOST.
 Most bounteous sir,
[Kneeling.]
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
As if my brother lived: I partly think
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
Till he did look on me: since it is so,
Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
In that he did the thing for which he died:
For Angelo,
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
And must be buried but as an intent
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.

"
48,mari.,MARIANA,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-mari.," Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.
Exit Boy. Enter DUKE disguised as before. 
I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical:
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

   Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

 Will 't please you walk aside?
[Exeunt Mariana and Isabella.
 Fear me not.

 Be ruled by him.

 I would Friar Peter--

 Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me.

    My lord, I do confess I ne'er was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.

 Now I come to't, my lord:
She that accuses him of fornication,
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
And charges him, my lord, with such a time
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love.

 Not that I know.

 Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

 My husband bids me; now I will
 unmask.
Unveiling. 
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
That took away the match from Isabel,
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
In her imagined person.

 Noble prince,
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
Let me in safety raise me from my knees;
Or else for ever be confixed here,
A marble monument!

 O my most gracious lord,
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

 O my dear lord,
I crave no other, nor no better man.

 Gentle my liege,--
[Kneeling.]
 O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.

 Isabel,
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
And, for the most, become much more the better
For being a little bad: so may my husband.
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

 Merely, my lord.

"
49,hero.,HERO,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml-hero.,"        Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites,
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
To listen our purpose. This is thy office;
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.

 Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
As we do trace this alley up and down,
Our talk must only be of Benedick.
When I do name him, let it be thy part
To praise him more than ever man did merit:
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
That only wounds by hearsay.
Enter BEATRICE, behind.
Now begin;

For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.

 Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
                 [Approaching the bower.
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
As haggerds of the rock.

 So says the prince and my newtrothed lord.

 They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
To wish him wrestle with affection,
And never to let Beatrice know of it.

 O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man:
But nature never framed a woman's heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
Misprising what they look on, and her wit
Values itself so highly that to her
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
She is so self-endeared.

 Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
But she would spell him backward: if fairfaced,
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
If low, an agate very vilely cut;
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
If silent, why, a block moved with none.
So turns she every man the wrong side out
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.

 No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
It were a better death than die with mocks,
Which is as bad as die with tickling.

 No; rather I will go to Benedick
And counsel him to fight against his passion.
And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
How much an ill word may empoison liking.

 He is the only man of Italy,
Always excepted my dear Claudio.

 Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.

 Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.

 If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
                     [Exeunt Hero and Ursula.
               And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?

 Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?

 True! O God!

 O, God defend me! how am I beset!
What kind of catechising call you this?

 Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
With any just reproach?

 I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.

 They know that do accuse me; I know none:
If I know more of any man alive
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
Prove you that any man with me conversed
At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!

 And when I lived, I was your other wife:
[Unmasking. 
And when you loved, you were my other husband.

 Nothing certainer:
One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
And surely as I live, I am a maid.

 And here's another
Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
Containing her affection unto Benedick.

"
50,dion.,Dionyza,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-dion.," That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
For who digs hills because they do aspire
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise. I'll do my best, sir.                  O, 'tis too true. Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it. O your sweet queen!
That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,
To have bless'd mine eyes with her! I have one myself,
Who shall not be more dear to my respect
Than yours, my lord. Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:
'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
A soldier to thy purpose.  How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
How chance my daughter is not with you?
 Do not
Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
A nurse of me.   Lord, how your favor's changed
With this unprofitable woe!
Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her. Come, come;
I love the king your father, and yourself,
With more than foreign heart. We every day
Expect him here: when he shall come and find
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
That excellent complexion, which did steal
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me;
I can go home alone. Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:
Remember what I have said. I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a  while:
Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:
What! I must have a care of you. Why, are you foolish?   Can it be undone? I think
You'll turn a child again. That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
Unless you play the pious innocent,
And for an honest attribute cry out
'She died by foul play.' Be one of those that think 
The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
And open this to Pericles.   I do shame
To think of what a noble strain you are,
And of how coward a spirit. Be it so, then:
Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
Nor none can know, Leonine being gone. 
She did distain my child, and stood between
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
But cast their gazes on Marina's face;
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
Not worth the time of day.   It pierced me thorough;
And though you call my course unnatural,
You not your child well loving, yet I find
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
Perform'd to your sole daughter. And as for Pericles,              
What should he say?   We wept after her hearse,
And yet we mourn: her monument
Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
In glittering golden characters express
A general praise to her, and care in us
At whose expense 'tis done. You are like one that superstitiously
Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:   
But yet I know you'll do as I advise.
[Exeunt."
51,mar.,Marina,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-mar.," No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,
To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,
The purple violets, and marigolds,
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
Born in a tempest, when my mother died,
This world to me is like a lasting storm, 
Whirring me from my friends. No, I pray you;
I'll not bereave you of your servant. Well, I will go;
But yet I have no desire to it. My thanks, sweet madam. 
Exit Dionyza.
Is this wind westerly that blows? When I was born, the wind was
north.  My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
But cried 'Good seamen!' to the sailors, galling
His kingly hands, haling ropes;
And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
That almost burst the deck. When I was born:
Never was waves nor wind more violent; 
And from the ladder-tackle washes off
A canvas-climber.   'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'
And with a dropping industry they skip
From stem   to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
The master calls, and trebles their confusion. What mean you? Why will you kill me? Why would she have me kill'd?
Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
I never did her hurt in all my life:
I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
To any living creature: believe me, la,
I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:
I trod upon a worm against my will,
But I wept for it. How have I offended, 
Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
Or my life imply her any danger? You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
You are well favor'd, and your looks foreshow
You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:
Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
And save poor me, the weaker. Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,
Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me  
For to seek my mother!         If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep, Untied I still my virgin knot will keep. Diana, aid my purpose!          If you were born to honor, show it now;
If put upon you, make the judgement good
That thought you worthy of it. For me,
That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune
Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,
Diseases have been sold dearer than physic.
O, that the gods
Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,
Though they did change me to the meanest bird
That flies i' the purer air! The good gods preserve you!      Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
Since they do better thee in their command.
Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
Of hell would not in reputation change:
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;
To the choleric fisting of every rogue
Thy ear is liable, thy food is such
As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs. Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty
Old receptacles, or common shores, of filth;
Serve by indenture to the common hangman:
Any of these ways are yet better than this;
For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,
Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods
Would safely deliver me from this place! 
Here, here's gold for thee.
If that thy master would gain by me,
Proclaim   that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast;
And I will undertake all these to teach.
I doubt not but this populous city will
Yield many scholars. Prove that I cannot, take me home again,    
And prostitute me to the basest groom
That doth frequent your house.  Sir, I will use
My utmost skill in his recovery,
Provided
That none but I and my companion maid
Be suffer'd to come near him. No, nor look'd on us. Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear. I am a maid,
My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
My derivation was from ancestors           
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
But time hath rooted out my parentage,
And to the world and awkward casualties
Bound me in servitude.   [Aside] I will desist;
But there is something glows upon my cheek,
And whispers in mine ear 'Go not till he speak.' I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,    
You would not do me violence. No, nor of any shores:
Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
No other than I appear. Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
You may discern the place. If I should tell my history, it would seem
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting. So indeed I did. Some such thing
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
Did warrant me was likely. My name is Marina. Patience, good sir,
Or here I'll cease. The name
Was given me by one that had some power,
My father, and a king. You said you would believe me;
But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
I will end here. Call'd Marina
For I was born at sea. My mother was the daughter of a king;
Who died the minute I was born,          
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
Deliver'd weeping. You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er. The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,
A crew of pirates came and rescued me;
Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
Whither will you have me?   Why do you weep?  It may be,
You think me an impostor: no, good faith;
I am the daughter to King Pericles,        
If good King Pericles be. First, sir, I pray,
What is your title? Is it no more to be your daughter than
To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
Thaisa was my mother, who did end
The minute I began. My heart
Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.   [Kneels to Thaisa."
52,thai.,Thaisa,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-thai.," It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express
My commendations great, whose merit's less. Which, to preserve mine honor, I'll perform.
Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his
Squire presents his shield to the Princess. A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun:     
The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.' A prince of Macedon, my royal fa- ther;
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is an arm'd knight that's conquered by a lady;
The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'
[The Third Knight passes over. The third of Antioch;
And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'      
[The Fourth Knight passes over. A burning torch that's turned upside down;
The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.' The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,
Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'
[The Sixth Knight, Pericles, passes over. He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.' But you, my knight and guest;
To whom this wreath of victory I give,     
And crown you king of this day's happiness. By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
All viands that I eat do seem unsavory, 
Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman. To me he seems like diamond to glass. What is it
To me, my father? Alas, my father, it befits not me
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
He may my proffer take for an offence,
Since men take women's gifts for impudence. Now, by the gods, he could not please me better. The king my father, sir, has drunk to you. Wishing it so much blood unto your life. And further he desires to know of you,
Of whence you are, your name and parentage. He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,
A gentleman of Tyre,
Who only by misfortune of the seas
Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore. Why, sir, say if you had,
Who takes offence at that would make me glad? Yes, if you love me, sir. O dear Diana,
Where am I?   Where's my lord?   What world is this? It is my lord's.
That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,
Even on my eaning time; but whether there
Deliver'd, by the holy gods,
I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
A vestal livery will I take me to,            
And never more have joy. My recompense is thanks, that's all;
Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.
[Exeunt.  Voice and favor!
You are, you are--O royal Pericles!  [Faints. O, let me look!
If he be none of mine, my sanctity
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear, 
But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,
Are you not Pericles?   Like him you spake,
Like him   you are: did you not name a tempest,
A birth, and death? That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
And drown'd. Now I know you better.
When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
The king my father gave you such a ring.  [Shows a ring. Blest, and mine own! I know you not. 'Twas Helicanus then. Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,
Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can  
From first to last resolve you. Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
My father's dead."
53,prin.,The PRINCESS of France,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-prin.," Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
Till painful study shall outwear three years,
No woman may approach his silent court:
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
Importunes personal conference with his grace:
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.

 All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
Exit Boyet.
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?

 Know you the man?

 Some merry mocking lord, belike; is 't so?

 Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
Who are the rest?

 God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
That every one her own hath garnished
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?

 Now, what admittance, lord?

  I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.

 Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.

 Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.

 Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
And sin to break it.
But pardon me, I am too sudden-bold:
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.

 You will the sooner, that I were away;
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.

 You do the king my father too much wrong
And wrong the reputation of your name,
In so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

 We arrest your word.
Boyet, you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father.

 Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!

 It was well done of you to take him at his word.

 Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
This civil war of wits were much better used
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.

   Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.

 Was that the king, that spurr'd his horse so hard
Against the steep uprising of the hill?

 Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
On Saturday we will return to France.
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
That we must stand and play the murderer in?

 I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.

 What, what? first praise me and again say no?
O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!

 Nay, never paint me now:
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
Fair payment for foul words is more than due.

 See, see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
And shooting well is then accounted ill.
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
Not wounding, pity would not let me do't:
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
And out of question so it is sometimes,
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
We bend to that the working of the heart;
As I for praise alone now seek to spill
The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.

 Only for praise: and praise we may afford
To any lady that subdues a lord.

   What's your will, sir? what's your will?

 O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
Stand aside, good bearer.   Boyet, you can carve;
Break up this capon.

 We will read it, I swear.
Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.

 What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?

 Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.

 Thou fellow, a word:
Who gave thee this letter?

 To whom shouldst thou give it?

 From which lord to which lady?

 Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
 [To Ros.[
Here, sweet, put up this; 'twill be thine another day.

[Exeunt Princess and train.
 Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
If fairings come thus plentifully in:
A lady wall'd about witth diamonds!
Look you what I have from the loving king.

 Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.

 Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
But, Rosaline, you have a favor too:
Who sent it? and what is it?

 Any thing like?

 Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.

 But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?

 Did he not send you twain?

 I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short?

 We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.

 None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd.
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.

 Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
                 Enter BOYET.
 Thy news, Boyet?

 Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.

 But what, but what, come they to visit us?

 And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
For, ladies, we will every one be mask'd;
And not a man of them shall have the grace,
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
And then the king will court thee for his dear;
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
And change you favors too; so shall your loves
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.

 The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
They do it but in mocking merriment;
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet,
With visages display'd, to talk and greet.

 No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.

 Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
Trumpets sound within. 
 Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.

 Seventh sweet, adieu:
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.

 Let it not be sweet.

 Gall! bitter.

 Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
Exeunt King, Lords, and Blackamoors.
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?

 O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.

 Biron did swear himself out of all suit.

 Qualm, perhaps.

 Go, sickness as thou art!

 And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.

 Will they return?

 How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.

 Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
If they return in their own shapes to woo?

 Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.

Exeunt Princess, Rosaline, Katharine, and Maria.
Re-enter the King, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper habits. 
 'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.

 Then wish me better; I will give you leave.

 This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.

 You nickname virtue: vice you should have spoke;
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
As the unsullied lily, I protest,
A world of torments though I should endure,
I would not yield to be your house's guest;
So much I hate a breaking cause to be
Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.

 Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
A mess of Russians left us but of late.

 Ay, in truth, my lord;
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.

 Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?

 No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.

 The fairest is confession.
Were not you here but even now disguised?

 And were you well advised?

 When you then were here,
What did you whisper in your lady's ear?

 When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.

 Peace, peace! forbear:
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.

 I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?

 God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
Most honorably doth unhold his word.

 Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?

 Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
When great things laboring perish in their birth.

   Great thanks, great Pompey.

 The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed. good Alexander.

 Stand aside, good Pompey.
Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules. 
 Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
          Enter ARMADO, for Hector.
 Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.

  Dead, for my life!

  Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
For all your fair endeavours; and entreat,
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits,
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
In the converse of breath: your gentleness
Was guilty of it. Farewell, worthy lord!
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.

 I understand you not: my griefs are double.

 We have received your letters full of love;
Your favors, the ambassadors of love;
And, in our maiden council, rated them
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
As bombast and as lining to the time:
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion, like a merriment.

 A time, methinks, too short
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
If for my love, as there is no such cause,
You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
But that it bear this trial and last love;
Then, at the expiration of the year,
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,
I will be thine; and till that instant shut
My woeful self up in a mourning house,
Raining the tears of lamentation
For the remembrance of my father's death.
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
Neither intitled in the other's heart.

 Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.

 Was not that Hector?

"
54,ros.,ROSALINE,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-ros.," Another of these students at that time
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal:
His eye begets occasion for his wit;
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

 Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

 How needless was it then to ask the question!

 'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.

 Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

        No point, with my knife.

 And yours from long living!

 Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.

 Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.

 Ay, our way to be gone.

 Shall I teach you to know?

 Why, she that bears the bow.
Finely put off!

 Well, then, I am the shooter.

 If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
Finely put on, indeed!

  Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
Thou canst not hit it, my good man.

 Madame, came nothing else along with that?

 That was the way to make his godhead wax,
For he hath been five thousand years a boy,

 You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.

 What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?

 We need more light to find your meaning out.

 Look, what you do, you do it still i' the dark.

 Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.

 Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'

 I would you knew:
An if my face were but as fair as yours,
My favour were as great: be witness this.
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs,
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!

 Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.

 'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
My red dominical, my golden letter:
O that your face were not so full of O's!

 They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
O that I knew he were but in by the week!
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
And wait the season and observe the times
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
And shape his service wholly to my hests
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
That he should be my fool and I his fate.

 The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.

 Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.

 But shall we dance, if they desire us to 't?

 What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
If they do speak our language, 'tis our will
That some plain man recount their purposes:
Know what they would.

 What would they, say they?

 Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.

 It is not so. Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
The measure then of one is easily told.

 How many weary steps,
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
Are number'd in the travel of one mile?

 My face is but a moon, and clouded too.

 O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.

 Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
Music plays. 
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.

 You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.

 Our ears vouchsafe it.

 Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.

 Only to part friends:
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.

 We can afford no more at such a price.

 Your absence only.

 Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
Twice to your visor, and half once to you.

 In private, then.

 Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.

 Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.

 O, they were all in lamentable cases!
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.

 Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.

 Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
Let's mock them still, as well known as disguised:
Let us complain to them what fools were here,
Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
And wonder what they were and to what end
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
Should be presented at our tent to us.

 Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
My lady, to the manner of the days,
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord.
They did not bless us with one happy word.
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.

 This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--

 But that you take what doth to you belong,
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.

 All the fool mine?

 Which of the vizards was it that you wore?

 There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
That hid the worse and show'd the better face.

 Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.

 Sans sans, I pray you.

 It is not so; for how can this be true,
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?

 Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.

 Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
As precious eyesight, and did value me
Above this world; adding thereto moreover
That he would wed me, or else die my lover.

 By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.

 We did not quote them so.

 You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd,
You are attaint with faults and perjury:
Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
But seek the weary beds of people sick.]

 Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
And therewithal to win me, if you please,
Without the which I am not to be won,
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
With all the fierce endeavour of your wit
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.

 Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
Deaf'd with the clamors of their own dear groans,
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
And I will have you and that fault withal;
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
And I shall find you empty of that fault,
Right joyful of your reformation.

"
55,queen.,GERTRUDE,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-queen.," Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids         
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.

 If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?

 Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us: go not to Wittenberg.

 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile,
For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.

 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

 Ay, amen!

Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants.
                Enter POLONIUS.
 I doubt it is no other but the main;
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.

 More matter, with less art.

 Came this from Hamlet to her?

 It may be, very likely.

 So he does indeed.

 But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

 Did he receive you well?   

 Did you assay him
To any pastime?

 I shall obey you.
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues 
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.

    I'll warrant you,
Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.

[Polonius hides behind the arras
Enter HAMLET.
 Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

 Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

 Why, how now, Hamlet!

 Have you forgot me?

 Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

 What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
 O me, what hast thou done?

 O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

 As kill a king!

 What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?

 Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

 O Hamlet, speak no more:
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.

 O, speak to me no more;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet!

 No more!

 Alas, he's mad!

 Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, 
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Start up, and stand an end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience.   Whereon do you look?

 To whom do you speak this?

 Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

 No, nothing but ourselves.

 This is the very coinage of your brain:
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.

 O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

 What shall I do?   

 Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me.

 Alack, 
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

 Bestow this place on us a little while.
Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!

 Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
'Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!' 
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
The unseen good old man.

 To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

 I will not speak with her.

 What would she have?

 Let her come in.
[Exit Horatio.
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
It spills itself in fearing to be split.
Re-enter HORATIO with OPHELIA.
 How now, Ophelia! Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

   Alack, what noise is this?

 How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs! 

 Calmly, good Laertes.

                  But not by him,

 One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
So fast they follow: your sister's drowned, Laertes.

 There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples 
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke:
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or like a creature native and indued        
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.

 Drown'd, drown'd.

 Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
        [Scattering flowers.
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
And not have strew'd thy grave.

                  Hamlet, Hamlet!

 O my son, what theme?

 For love of God, forbear him.

 This is mere madness:
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
His silence will sit drooping.

 He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

 I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

 Come, let me wipe thy face.

 No, no, the drink, the drink,— O my dear Hamlet,— 
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.    [Dies.
"
56,oph.,OPHELIA,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,0,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-oph.," Do you doubt that?

 No more but so?

 I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.

 'Tis in my memory locked,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

 So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

 He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me.                       

 I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

 My lord, he hath importuned me with love 
In honorable fashion.

 And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

 I shall obey, my lord.
Exeunt. O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!

 My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle; 
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors,—he comes before me.

 My lord, I do not know;
But truly, I do fear it.

 He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
He falls to such perusal of my face       
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
And, to the last, bended their light on me.

 No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
I did repel his letters and denied
His access to me.

 Madam, I wish it may.  [Exit Queen.
 Good my lord, 
How does your honor for this many a day?

 My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.

 My honor'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind 
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.

         O, what a noble mind is here o'er- thrown!
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,   
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
         Re-enter KING and POLONIUS.
                 Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

 How should I your true love know 
	      From another one?
	      By his cockle hat and staff,
	      And his sandal shoon.
	     He is dead and gone, lady,
	       He is dead and gone;          
	      At his head a grass-green turf,
	       At his heels a stone.
	     White his shroud as the mountain snow,—
	     Larded with sweet flowers;
	       Which bewept to the grave did go
	      With true-love showers.
	      To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
	       All in the morning betime,
	      And I a maid at your window, 
	       To be your Valentine.
	      Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes, 
	      And dupp'd the chamber door;
	      Let in the maid, that out a maid
	      Never departed more.
	     By Gis and by Saint Charity,
	      Alack, and fie for shame!        
	      Young men will do't, if they come to't;    
	      By cock, they are to blame.
	      Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
	      You promised me to wed.
	      So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
	      An thou hadst not come to my bed. 
	      They bore him barefaced on the bier;
	      Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
	      And in his grave rain'd many a tear:—
	    Fare you well, my dove!

 You must sing a-down a-down,
	       An you call him a-down-a.
	      For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
		 And will he not come again?
		And will he not come again?
		No, no, he is dead:
		Go to thy death-bed:
		He never will come again.
	      His beard was as white as snow,
		All flaxen was his poll:
		He is gone, he is gone,

"
57,laer.,LAERTES,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-laer.," My dread lord, 
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

 My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.

 For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
No more.

 Think it no more:     
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal.   Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs, 
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, 
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

 O, fear me not. 
I stay too long: but here my father comes.

Enter POLONIUS.
A double blessing is a double grace;
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

 Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

 Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
What I have said to you.

 Farewell.  Exit.
 Where is this king?   Sirs, stand you all without.

 I pray you, give me leave.

 I thank you; keep the door.   O thou vile king,
Give me my father!

 That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
Of my true mother.

 Where is my father?

 How came he dead?   I'll not be juggled with: 
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
Most throughly for my father.

 My will, not all the world:
And for my means, I'll husband them   so well,
They shall go far with little.

 None but his enemies.

 To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
Repast them with my blood.

 How now! what noise is that?

               Re-enter OPHELIA.
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
Should be as moral as an old man's life? 
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.
 Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
It could not move thus.
   Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
She turns to favor and to prettiness.
  Let this be so;
His means of death, his obscure funeral—
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No noble rite nor formal ostentation—
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call't in question.

 It well appears: but tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
You mainly were stirr'd up.

 And so have I a noble father lost;
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.

 Know you the hand?

 I'm lost in it, my lord.   But let him come;
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
'Thus didest thou.'

 Ay, my lord;   
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

 My lord, I will be ruled;
The rather, if you could devise it so         
That I might be the organ.

 What part is that, my lord?

 A Norman was't?

 Upon my life, Lamond.

 I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation.

 What out of this, my lord?

 Why ask you this?   

 To cut his throat i' the church.

 I will do't:   
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
It may be death.

 Drown'd!   O, where?

 Alas, then, she is drown'd?

 Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
But that this folly douts it.
Exit.
 What ceremony else?

  Must there no more be done?

 Lay her i' the earth:
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring!   I tell thee, churlish priest,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
When thou liest howling.

 O, treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, 
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:       
Leaps into the grave.
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
To o'erton old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus.

 The devil take thy soul!
[Grappling with him.
 I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters, of known honor,
I have a voice and precedent of peace, 
To keep my name ungored.   But till that time,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
And will not wrong it.

 Come, one for me.

 You mock me, sir.

 This is too heavy, let me see another.

 Come, my lord.
They play.
 No.

 Well; again.

 A touch, a touch, I do confess.

 My lord, I'll hit him now.

 And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.

 Say you so? come on.
[They play.
 Have at you now!
[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling,
 they change rapiers, and Hamlet
 wounds Laertes.
 Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

 It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice
Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie, 
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.

 He is justly served;
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, 
Nor thine on me!       [Dies.
"
58,gui.,GUIDERIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cym.xml-gui.,"         Hail, heaven!

 Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,
Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not
What air's from home.   Haply this life is best,
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
That have a sharper known; well corresponding
With your stiff age: but unto us it is
A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;
A prison for a debtor, that not dares
To stride a limit.

 Uncertain favor!

 I am thoroughly weary.

 There is cold meat i' the cave: we'll browse on that,
Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.

 What's the matter, sir?

 Money, youth?

 Were you a woman, youth,
I should woo hard but be your groom.   In honesty,
I bid for you as I'ld buy.

 Would I could free't!

 Pray, draw near.

 Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.

 I love thee; I have spoke it:
How much the quantity, the weight as much,
As I do love my father.

 I could not stir him:
He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.

 But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
In characters,
And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick
And he her dieter.

 I do note
That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
Mingle their spurs together.

 He is but one: you and my brother search
What companies are near: pray you, away;
Let me alone with him.
[Exeunt Belarius and Arviragus.
 A thing
More slavish did I ne'er than answering
A slave without a knock.

 To who? to thee?   What art thou? Have not I
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art.
Why I should yield to thee?

 No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
Which, as it seems, make thee.

 Hence, then, and thank
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
I am loath to beat thee.

 What's thy name?

 Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,
'Twould move me sooner.

 I am sorry for't; not seeming
So worthy as thy birth.

 Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:
At fools I laugh, not fear them.

 This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
There was no money in 't: not Hercules
Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
My head as I do his.

 I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
Son to the queen, after his own report;
Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
With his own single hand he'ld take us in,
Displace our heads where--thank the gods!-- they grow,
And set them on Lud's-town.

 Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,
But that he swore to take, our lives?   The law
Protects not us: then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
Play judge and executioner all himself,
For we do fear the law?   What company
Discover you abroad?

 With his own sword,
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,
And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:
That's all I reck.
[Exit.
 Where's my brother?
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage
For his return.  [Solemn music.
 Is he at home?

 What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
It did not speak before. All solemn things
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
Is Cadwal mad?

 O sweetest, fairest lily!
My brother wears thee not the one half so well
As when they grew'st thyself.

                 Where?

 Why, he but sleeps:
If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
And worms will not come to thee.

 Prithee, have done;
And do not play in wench-like words with that
Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
And not protract with admiration what
Is now due debt. To the grave!

 By good Euriphile, our mother.

 Cadwal,
I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
Than priests and fanes that lie.

 Pray you, fetch him hither.
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
When neither are alive.

 Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;
My father hath a reason for't.

 Come on then, and remove him.

 Fear no more the heat o' the sun,
 Nor the furious winter's rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done,
 Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:""
Golden lads and girls all must,
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

 Fear no more the lightning-flash,

 Fear not slander, censure rash;

 No exorciser harm thee!

 Ghost unlaid forbear thee!

 We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.

 The noise is round about us.

 Nay, what hope
Have we in hiding us?   This way, the Romans
Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
During their use, and slay us after.

 This is, sir, a doubt
In such a time nothing becoming you,
Nor satisfying us.

 Than be so
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:
I and my brother are not known; yourself
So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
Cannot be question'd.

 By heavens, I'll go:
If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
I'll take the better care, but if you will not,
The hazard therefore due fall on me by
The hands of Romans!

 The same dead thing alive.

 But we saw him dead.

 This is, sure, Fidele.

 Let me end the story:
I slew him there.

 I have spoke it, and I did it.

 A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
With language that would make me spurn the sea,
If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine.

 And our good his.

 And at first meeting loved;
Continued so, until we thought he died.

"
59,adam.,ADAM,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-adam.,"    What, my young master? O my gentle master!
O my sweet master! O you memory
Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
O, what a world is this, when what is comely
Envenoms him that bears it!

 O unhappy youth!
Come not within these doors; within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives:
Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
Yet not the son, I will not call him son
Of him I was about to call his father--
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
To burn the lodging where you use to lie
And you within it: if he fail of that,
He will have other means to cut you off.
I overheard him and his practices.
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

 No matter whither, so you come not here.

 But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
And unregarded age in corners thrown:
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility;
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
I'll do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities.

 Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
Here lived I, but now live here no more.
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
But at fourscore it is too late a week:
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
Than to die well and not my master's debtor.
                            [Exeunt.  So had you need:
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

"
60,hel.,Helicanus,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-hel.," Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
They do abuse the king that flatter him:
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
The thing the which is flatter'd, but a spark, 
To which that blast gives heat and stronger
 glowing;
Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;
I cannot be much lower than my knees. An angry brow, dread lord. How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence
They have their nourishment? I have ground the axe myself;
Do you but strike the blow. To bear with patience
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.           Alas, sir! Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
Who either by public war or private treason
Will take away your life.
Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
Your rule direct to any; if to me,
Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be. We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
From whence we had our being and our birth. You shall not need, my fellow peers
 of Tyre,
Further to question me of your king's departure:
His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,
Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel. If further yet you will be satisfied,
Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,
He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.
Being at Antioch-- Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--     
Took some displeasure at him; at least he     judged so: 
And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;
So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
With whom each minute threatens life or death. Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome. We have no reason to desire it,
Commended to our master, not to us:
Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire, 
As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.
[Exeunt No, Escanes, know this of me,
Antiochus from incest lived not free:
For which, the most high gods not minding longer
To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,
Due to this heinous capital offence,
Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
When he was seated in a chariot
Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk, 
That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
Scorn now their hand should give them burial. And yet but justice; for though
This king were great, his greatness was no guard
To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward. With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords. Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love. For honor's cause, forbear your suffrages:
If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
A twelve month longer, let me entreat you to
Forbear the absence of your king;
If in which time expired, he not return,
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
But if I cannot win you to this love,
Go search like nobles, like noble subjects, 
And in your search spend your adventurous worth;
Whom if you find, and win unto return,
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown. Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.

Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords;
   with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors.  And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
And die as I would do. First, what is your place?           Sir,
Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;
A man who for this three months hath not spoken
To any one, nor taken sustenance
But to prorogue his grief. 'Twould be too tedious to repeat;
But the main grief springs from the loss
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.          You may;
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak
To any. Behold him.   Pericles discovered.
This was a goodly person,
Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
Drove him to this. It is in vain; he will not speak to you. Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit
That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness
We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you
That for our gold we may provision have,
Wherein we are not destitute for want,
But weary for the staleness. Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:
But, see, I am prevented.
Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA and a young Lady. She's a gallant lady. Calls my lord? I know not; but
Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene

That's clapp'd upon the court-gate.

 The reformation of our travell'd gallants,
That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.

 They must either,
For so run the conditions, leave those remnants
Of fool and feather that they got in France,
With all their honourable points of ignorance
Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,
Abusing better men than they can be,
Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean
The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,
Short blister'd breeches, and those types of travel,
And understand again like honest men;
Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,
They may, 'cum privilegio,' wear away
The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.

 Ay, marry,
There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.

 To the cardinal's:
Your lordship is a guest too.

 That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
His dews fall every where.

 O, that your lordship were but now confessor
To one or two of these!

 Faith, how easy?

 Yes, my lord.

 I do beseech your grace, for charity,
If ever any malice in your heart
Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.

 To the water side I must conduct your grace;
Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,
Who undertakes you to your end.

 Came you from the king, my lord?

 I must to him too,
Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.

 My lord, I love you;
And durst commend a secret to your ear
Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,
They say, in great extremity; and fear'd
She'll with the labour end.

 Methinks I could
Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
Deserve our better wishes.

 Now, sir, you speak of two
The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,
Beside that of the jewel house, is made master
O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,
Stands in lte gap and trade of moe preferments,
With which the time will load him.   The archbishop
Is the king's hand and tongue'; and who dare speak
One syllable against him?

 Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.
Exeunt Gardiner and Page. 
Enter the KING and SUFFOLK. 
 I could not personally deliver to her
What you commanded me, but by her woman
I sent your message; who return'd her thanks
In the greatest humbleness, and desired your highness
Most heartily to pray for her.

 So said her woman; and that her sufferance made
Almost each pang a death.

 This is about that which the bishop spake:
I am happily come hither.
Re-enter DENNY, with CRANMER.
 Sir?

62,duke.,VINCENTIO,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-duke.," Escalus.

 Of government the properties to unfold,
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
My strength can give you: then no more remains,
But that to your sufficiency........
....................as your worth is able,
And let them work. The nature of our people,
Our city's institutions, and the terms
For common justice, you're as pregnant in
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission,
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
I say, bid come before us Angelo.

[Exit an Attendant.
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know, we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply,
Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power: what think you of it?

 Look where he comes.
                 Enter ANGELO.
 Angelo,
There is a kind of character in thy life,
That to the observer doth thy history
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor,
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore, Angelo:--
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
Though first in question, is thy secondary.
Take thy commission.

 No more evasion:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
As time and our concernings shall importune,
How it goes with us, and do look to know
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well:
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.

 My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own,
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
I'll privily away. I love the people,
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
Though it do well, I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

 I thank you. Fare you well.
[Exit.
 No, holy father; throw away that thought;
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.

 My holy sir, none better knows than you
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
You will demand of me why I do this?

 We have strict statutes and most biting laws,
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
Only to stick it in their children's sight
For terror, not to use, in time the rod
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
Goes all decorum.

 I do fear, too dreadful:
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
I have on Angelo imposed the office;
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. Moe reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you;
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows, or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

Exeunt.
 Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.

 Bound by my charity and my blest order,
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
To them accordingly.

 When must he die?

 Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

 I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
And try your penitence, if it be sound,
Or hollowly put on.

 Love you the man that wrong'd you?

 So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?

 Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

 'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
But as we stand in fear,--

 There rest.
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
And I am going with instruction to him.
Grace go with you, Benedicite! [Exit.
 So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

 Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter.   Reason thus with life:
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
Servile to all the skyey influences,
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet runn'st toward him still.   Thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
And that thou oft provokes; yet grossly fear'st
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
And what thou hast, forget'st.   Thou art not certain;
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,
And death unloads thee.   Friend hast thou none;
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
For ending thee no sooner.   Thou hast nor youth nor age,
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
Dreaming on both; for ail thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
That makes these odds all even.

 Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

 Provost, a word with you.

 Bring me to hear them speak, where
I may be concealed.
[Exeunt Duke and Provost.
 Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

               Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
The evil that thou causest to be done,
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
From their abominable and beastly touches
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

 Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit.

 That we were all, as some would seem to be,
From our fault as faults from seeming, free!

                    No might nor greatness in mortality
Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
But who comes here?
Enter ESCALUS, PROVOST, and Officers with
MISTRESS OVERDONE.
  Not of this country, though my chance is now
To use it for my time: I am a brother
Of gracious order, late come from the See
In special business from his holiness.

     He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe;
Pattern in himself to know,
Grace to stand, and virtue go;
More nor less to others paying
Than by self-offences weighing.
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking!
Twice treble shame on Angelo,
To weed my vice and let his grow!
O, what may man within him hide,
Though angel on the outward side!
How may likeness made in crimes,
Making practice on the times,
To draw with idle spiders' strings
Most ponderous and substantial things
Craft against vice I must apply:
With Angelo to-night shall lie
His old betrothed but despised;
So disguise shall, by the disguised,
Pay with falsehood false exacting,
And perform an old contracting.
[Exit.
 'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray you, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised here to meet.

  Very well met, and well come.
What is the news from this good deputy?

 But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

 Are there no other tokens
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

 'Tis well borne up.
I have not yet made known to Mariana

A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
               Re-enter MARIANA.
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
She comes to do you good.

 Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

 Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
Who hath a story ready for your ear.
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
The vaporous night approaches.

 O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quests
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dreams
And rack thee in their fancies.
Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA.
Welcome, how agreed?

 It is not my consent,
But my entreaty too.

 Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
He is your husband on a pre-contract:
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

[Exeunt.
 The best and wholesomest spirits of the night
Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

 Not Isabel?

 They will, then, ere't be long.

 There's some in hope.

 Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
That in himself which he spurs on his power
To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
But this being so, he's just.
[Knocking within.]
Now are they come.

[Exit Provost.
This is a gentle provost: seldom when
The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
[Knocking within.] 
How now! what noise? That spirit's possess'd with haste
That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
               Re-enter PROVOST.
 Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
But he must die to-morrow?

 As near the dawning, provost as it is,
You shall hear more ere morning.

 And here comes Claudlo's pardon.
 This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
For which the pardoner himself is in.
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
When it is borne in high authority:
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
Now, sir, what news?

 Pray you, let's hear.

                 Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
[Exeunt Abhorson and Pompey.
                Enter PROVOST.
 A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.

 O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
And sent according to command; whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

 Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation, you shall find
Your safety manifested.

 Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
[Exit Provost.
Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
The provost, he shall bear them,--whose contents
Shall witness to him I am near at home,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence,
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
We shall proceed with Angelo.
              Re-enter PROVOST.
 Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.

 The tongue of Isabel.   She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
When it is least expected.
               Enter ISABELLA.
 Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

 He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

 It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
In your close patience.

 You shall not be admitted to his sight.

 This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say, which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
One of our convent, and his confessor,
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
In that good path that I would wish it go,
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
Grace of the duke, revenge to your heart,
And general honour.

 This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
Say, by this token, I desire his company
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart: trust not my holy order,
If I pervert your course. Who's here?
                 Enter Lucio.
 Not within, sir.

  Well, you'll answer this one day.
Fare ye well.

  Did you such a thing?

  These letters at fit time deliver me:
[Giving letters.
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift;
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
But send me Flavius first.

 I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

[Exeunt.
 My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

 Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
Forerunning more requital.

 O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
When it deserves, with characters of brass,
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
And let the subject see, to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
You must walk by us on our other hand;
And good supporters are you.
FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward.
 Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.

 Nay, it is ten times strange.

 Away with her! Poor soul,
She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

 By mine honesty,
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
Such a dependency of thing on thing,
As e'er I heard in madness.

 Many that are not mad
Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

 You were not bid to speak.

 I wish you now, then;
Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
Be perfect.

 The warrant's for yourself; take heed to't.

 It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.

 That's somewhat madly spoken.

 Mended again. The matter; proceed.

 This is most likely!

 By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,
Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
In hateful practice. First, his integrity
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
Thou camest here to complain.

 I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us?   This needs must be a practice.
Who knew of your intent and coming hither?

 A ghostly father, belike.   Who knows that Lodowick?

 Words against me! this is a good friar, belike!
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

 We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

 Good friar, let's hear it.

Isabella is carried off guarded; and
Mariana comes forward.
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?

First let her show her face, and after speak.

       This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

 No? you say your husband.

 Know you this woman?

 Sirrah, no more!

 Ay, with my heart;
And punish them to your height of pleasure
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
Though they would swear down each particular saint,
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
That's seal'd in approbation?   You, Lord Escalus,
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.

 Go do it instantly.
[Exit Provost.
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
Do with your injuries as seems you best,
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers.

  Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

 Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
Which here you come to accuse.

 Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
Nor here provincial. My business in this state
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
As much in mock as mark.

     Stay, sir; stay awhile.

 Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
 [To Lucio]
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

 What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
We'll borrow place of him. [To Angelo]
Sir, by your leave.
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
And hold no longer out.

 Come hither, Mariana.
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

 Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

[Exeunt Angelo, Mariana, Friar Peter and Provost.
 Come hither, Isabel.
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
Advertising and holy to your business;
Not changing heart with habit, I am still
Attorney'd at your service.

 You are pardon'd, Isabel:
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
Laboring to save his life, and would not rather
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
It was the swift celerity of his death,
Which I did think with slower foot came on,
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
That life is better life, past fearing death,
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
So happy is your brother.

 For this new-married man approaching here,
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
Your well defended honour, you must pardon
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
Being criminal, in double violation
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!
Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
Then Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
Away with him!

 It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
For that he knew you, might reproach your life
And choke your good to come: for his possessions,
Although by confiscation they are ours,
We do instate and widow you withal,
To buy you a better husband.

 Never crave him; we are definitive.

 You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death! [To Lucio]
Now, sir, to you.

 Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact.
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
And take her hence in horror.

 He dies for Claudio's death.

 Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour?

 Had you a special warrant for the deed?

 For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.

 What's he?

 I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

[Exit Provost.
 Which is that Barnardine?

 There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,
That apprehends no further than this world,
And squarest thy life according.   Thou'rt condemn'd:
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

 If he be like your brother, for his sake
Is he pardon'd; and for your lovely sake,
Give me your hand and say you will be mine,
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
I find an apt remission in myself;
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
[To Lucio]
You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
Wherein have I so deserved of you,
That you extol me thus?

 Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city,
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
As I have heard him swear himself there's one
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

 Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.

 Slandering a prince deserves it.
[Exeunt Officers with Lucio.
She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
We shall employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
I have a motion much imports your good;
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
[Exeunt. 
"
63,cor-6,CAIUS MARCIUS,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-6," Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?

 He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring.   What would you have, you curs,
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down oaks with rushes.   Hang ye!   Trust ye?
With every minute you do change a mind,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland.   What's the matter,
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble senate, who,
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
Would feed on one another?   What's their seeking ?

 Hang 'em!   They say!
They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
Who thrives and who declines; side factions and give out
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's grain enough!
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
And let me use my sword, I'ld make a quarry
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
As I could pick my lance.

 They are dissolved: hang 'em!
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
And a petition granted them, a strange one—
To break the heart of generosity,
And make bold power look pale—they threw their caps
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
Shouting their emulation.

 Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not—'Sdeath!
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
For insurrection's arguing.

 Go, get you home, you fragments!
Enter a Messenger, hastily.
 Here: what's the matter?

 I am glad on't: then we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other
Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS
VELUTUS.
 They have a leader,
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I any thing but what I am,
I would wish me only he.

 Were half to half the world by the ears and he
Upon my party, I'ld revolt, to make
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.

 Sir, it is;
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?

 Nay, let them follow:
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.

Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but Sicinius and Brutus.
 Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.

 'Tis done.

 Say, has our general met the enemy?

 I'll buy him of you.

 How far off lie these armies?

 Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
They sound a parley.   Enter two Senators
with others on the walls.
Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

 O, they are at it!

 They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus:
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
Which makes me sweat with wrath.   Come on, my fellows:
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce,
And he shall feel mine edge.
Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches.
 Re-enter MARCIUS, cursing.
 All the contagion of the south light on you,
You shames of Rome? you herd of—Boils and plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
Further than seen and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With fright and agued fear!   Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on:
If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches followed.

Another alarum.   The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows them to the gates.
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

Enters the gates.
 See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd   drachma!   Cushions, leaden spoons,
Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
To help Cominius.

 Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
I will appear, and fight.

 Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.

 Come I too late?

 Come I too late?

 O, let me clip ye
In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
And tapers burn'd to bedward!

 As with a man busied about decrees:
Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
To let him slip at will.

 Let him alone;
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
The common file—a plague! tribunes for them! —
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
From rascals worse than they.

 Will the time serve to tell?   I do not think.
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
If not, why cease you till you are so?

 How lies their battle? know you on which side
They have placed their men of trust?

 I do beseech you,
By all the battles wherein we have fought,
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
We have made to endure friends, that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you not delay the present, but,
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
We prove this very hour.

 Those are they
That most are willing: If any such be here—
As it were sin to doubt—that love this painting
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country's dearer than himself;
Let him alone, or so many so minded,
Wave thus, to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius.

They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps.
O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
If these shows be not outward, which of you
But is four Volsces? none of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
Though thanks to all, must I select from all: the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight,
As cause will be obey'd.   Please you to march;
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
Which men are best inclined.

 I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.

 Let the first budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom him after!

  Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to the highest.

  Pray now, no more: my mother,
Who has a charter to extol her blood,
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
As you have done; that's what I can; induced
As you have been; that's for my country:
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.

 I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
To hear themselves remember'd.

 I thank you, general;
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
And stand upon my common part with those
That have beheld the doing.

A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!' cast up their caps and lances: Cominius and Lartius stand bare.
 May these same instruments, which you profane,
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
Made all of false-faced soothing!
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
No more, I say!   For that I have not wash'd
My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch,—
Which, without note, here's many else have done,—
You shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical;
As if I loved my little should be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.

 I will go wash;
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power.

 The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
Of my lord general.

 I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was within my view,
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
To give my poor host freedom.

 By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
Have we no wine here?

 No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more.

 O,
You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
For my prosperity!Kneels.
 My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
That weep'st to see me triumph?   Ah, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.

 And live you yet? To Valeria
O my sweet lady, pardon.

 Menenius ever, ever.

 Your hand, and yours:
Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
The good patricians must be visited;
From whom I have received not only greetings,
But with them change of honours.

 Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way
Than sway with them in theirs.

 Your honours' pardon:
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.

 No, sir: yet oft,
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but your people,
I love them as they weigh.

 I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.
Exit.
 I do owe them still
My life and services.

 I do beseech you,
Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
That I may pass this doing.

 It is a part
That I shall blush in acting, and might well
Be taken from the people.

 To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had received them for the hire
Of their breath only!

 What must I say?
'I pray, sir,'—Plague upon't! I cannot bring
My tongue to such a pace:—'Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service, when
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
From the noise of our own drums.'

 Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would forget me, like the virtues
Which our divines lose by 'em.

 Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean. Re-enter two of the Citizens.
So, here comes a brace.

Re-enter a third Citizen.
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here.

           Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
Their needless vouches?   Custom calls me to 't:
What custom wills, in all things should we do 't,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do this.   I am   half through;
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
         Re-enter three Citizens more.
Here come more voices.
Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices; for your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
Done many things, some less, some more: your voices:
Indeed, I would be consul.

  Is this done?

 Where? at the senate-house?

 May I change these garments?

 That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.

 Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

 So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
Upon's again.

 Saw you Aufidius?

 Spoke he of me?

 How? what?

 At Antium lives he?

 I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
For they do prank them in authority,
Against all noble sufferance.

 Ha! what is that?

 What makes this change?

  Have I had children's voices?

 Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues?   What are your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?

 It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will of the nobility:
Suffer 't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled.

 Why, this was known before.

 Have you inform'd them sithence?

 Why then should I be consul?   By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow tribune.

 Tell me of corn
This was my speech, and I will speak 't again—

 Now, as I live, I will.   My nobler friends,
I crave their pardons:
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Which they have given to beggars.

 How! no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them.

 Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove! 'twould be my mind!

 Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

 'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power,
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you.   You are plebeians,
If they be senators: and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall,' against a graver bench
Than ever frown'd in Greece. By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.

 Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,—

 Though there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

 I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
They ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war.
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Which they have often made against the senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate's courtesy?   Let deeds express
What's like to be their words: 'We did request it;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.

 No, take more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance,—it must omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd, it follows,
Nothing is done to purpose.   Therefore, beseech you,—
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Mangles true judgement and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For the ill which doth control't.

 Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes ?
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
When what's not meet, but what must be was law,
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
And throw their power i' the dust.

 Hence, old goat! Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments.

 No, I'll die here.

Drawing his sword.
There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

 I would they were barbarians—as they are,
Though in Rome litter'd—not Romans—as they are not,
Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol—

 On fair ground
I could beat forty of them.

 Let them pull all about mine ears, present me
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
Be thus to them.

 I muse my mother
Does not approve me further, who was wont
To call them woollen vassals, things created
To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war.
Enter VOLUMNIA.
I talk of you:
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
False to my nature? Rather say I play
The man I am.

 Let go.

 Let them hang.

 What must I do?

 Well, what then? what then?

 For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?

 Tush, tush!

 Why force you this?

 Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
And throw 't against the wind. To the marketplace!
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to the life.

 Well, I must do't:
Away, my disposition, and possess me
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.

 Pray, be content:
Mother, I am going to the market-place;
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I' the way of flattery further.

 The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
Let them accuse me by invention, I
Will answer in mine honour.

 Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
Exeunt.
 Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
Will bear the knave by the volume.   The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
Supplied   with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
And not our streets with war!

 First, hear me speak.

 Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?

 I am content.

 Scratches with briers,
Scars to move laughter only.

 What is the matter
That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
You take it off again?

 Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

 How! traitor!

 The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
In thy hands clutch'd as many millions, in
Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray the gods.

 What do you prate of service?

 You?

 I'll know no further:
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
Vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger
But with a grain a day, I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
Nor check my courage for what they can give,
To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

 You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despair!   Have the power still
To banish your defenders; till at length
Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you as most
Abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows! Despising,
For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
There is a world elsewhere.

Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, Menenius, Senators, and Patricians.

 Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
Where is your ancient courage? you were used
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
That common chances common men could bear;
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that conn'd them.

 Nay, I prithee, woman,—

 What, what, what!
I shall be loved when I am   lack'd.   Nay, mother,
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
If you had been the wife of Hercules,
Six of his labours you 'ld have done, and saved
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
Droop not; adieu.   Farewell, my wife, my mother:
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
My hazards still have been your solace: and
Believe 't not lightly—though I go alone,
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen—your son
Will or exceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practice.

 O the gods!

 Fare ye well:
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
While I remain above the ground, you shall
Hear from me still, and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly.

 Give me thy hand:
Come.

Exeunt.
 A goodly city is this Antium. City,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay me.
Enter a Citizen.
Save you, sir.

 Direct me, if it be your will,
Where great Aufidius lies; is he in Antium?

 Which is his house, beseech you?

 Thank you, sir: farewell.

Exit Citizen.
O world, thy slippery turns!   Friends now fast sworn,
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
On a dissension of a doit, break out
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
To take the one the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
He does fair justice; if he give me way,
I'll do his country service.
Exit.
 A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear not like a guest.

Re-enter the first Servingman.
 I have deserved no better entertainment,
In being Coriolanus.
Re-enter second Servingman.
            If, Tullus,                  Unmuffling. 
Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself.

 A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.

 Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st thou me yet?

 My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope—
Mistake me not—to save my life, for if
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight,
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou durst not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou 'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

 You bless me, gods!

 What's the matter?

 Away!

 Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
Are servanted to others: though I owe
My revenge properly, my remission lies
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake,

Gives a letter.
And would have sent it.   Another word, Menenius,
I will not hear thee speak.   This man, Aufidius,
Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!

 We will before the walls of Rome to-morrow
Set down our host. My partner in this action,
You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
I have borne this business.

 This last old man,
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
Loved me above the measure of a father;
Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
The first conditions, which they did refuse
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That thought he could do more, a very little
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shout within.
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time 'tis made?   I will not.

Enter, in mourning habits, VIRGILIA,
VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants.
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
All bond and privilege of nature, break!
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
Of stronger earth than others.   My mother bows;
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod: and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession, which
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' Let the Volsces
Plough Rome, and harrow Italy: I'll never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
As if a man were author of himself
And knew no other kin.

 These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

 Like a dull actor now,
I have forgot my part, and I am out,
Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world
Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;

Kneels.
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons.

 What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibility, to make
What cannot be, slight work.

 The noble sister of Publicola,
The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
That's curdled by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

 The god of soldiers,
With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
And saving those that eye thee!

 That's my brave boy!

 I beseech you, peace:
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by your denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
To allay my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons.

 Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
Hear nought from   Rome in private.   Your request?

 Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
I have sat too long.
Rising.
 O mother, mother!
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But, for your son,—believe it, O, believe it,
Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
If not most mortal to him. But, let come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
Were you in my stead, would you have heard
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?

 I dare be sworn you were:
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

 Ay, by and by;

To Volumnia, Virgilia, &c.
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A better witness back than words, which we,
On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
To have a temple built you: all the swords
In Italy, and her confederate arms,
Could not have made this peace.
Exeunt. 
 Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my country's love
Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
Under your great command. You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the action.  We have made peace
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
Together with the seal o' the senate, what
We have compounded on.

 Traitor! how now!

 Marcius!

 Hear'st thou, Mars?

 Ha!

 Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
I was forced to scold. Your judgements, my grave lords,
Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion—
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave—shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.

 Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I did it. Boy!

 O that I had him,
With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
To use my lawful sword!

"
64,clar.,GEORGE,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-clar.," His majesty,
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

 Because my name is George.

 Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be;
And, for my name of George begins with G,
It follows in his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
Have moved his highness to commit me now.

 By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?

 We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

 I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

 I must perforce. Farewell.
[Exeunt Clarence, Brakenbury, and Guard.
 O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!

 Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.

 Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

 O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I trembling awaked, and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made the dream.

 O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

 Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.

 In God's name, what art thou?

 But not, as I am, royal.

 Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

 How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Who sent you hither?   Wherefore do you come?

 To murder me?

 You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

 I shall be reconciled to him again.

 Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent?   What is my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands on me:
The deed you undertake is damnable.

 Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.

 Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake:
Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me for this;
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be revenged for this deed,
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly:
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.

 My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

 Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

 O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him from me.

 Tell him, when that our princely father York
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.

 O, do not slander him, for he is kind.

 It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would labor my delivery.

 Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.

 Relent, and save your souls.

 Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
As you would beg, were you in my distress:
A begging prince what beggar pities not?

65,tgv-13,Outlaws,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-13," Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.

 If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED.
 Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:
If not, we'll make you sit and rifle you.

 That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.

 Peace! we'll hear him.

 Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.

   Have you long sojourned there?

 What, were you banish'd thence?

  Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?

 Have you the tongues?

 By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar.
This fellow were a king for our wild faction!

  Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?

 Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
Thrust from the company of awful men:
Myself was from Verona banished
For practising to steal away a lady,
An heir, and near allied unto the duke.

 And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.

 And I for such like petty crimes as these.
But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
That they may hold excused our lawless lives;
And partly, seeing you are beautified
With goodly shape and by your own report
A linguist and a man of such perfection
As we do in our quality much want--

 Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
Are you content to be our general?
To make a virtue of necessity
And live, as we do, in this wilderness?

 What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
Say ay, and be captain of us all:
We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
Love thee as our commander and our king.

 But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.

 Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.

 No, we detest such vile base practices.
Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
And show thee all the treasure we have got;
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.
                                     [Exeunt.
 Come, come,
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.

 Come, bring her away.

 Where is the gentleman that was with her?

 Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.

 Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
Fear not; he bears an honorable mind,
And will not use a woman lawlessly.

 "
66,fer.,FERDINAND,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-fer.," Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and, sure it waits upon
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
This music crept by me upon the waters,
Allaying both their fury and my passion
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
Or it hath drawn me rather.   But 'tis gone,
No, it begins again.
ARIEL sings.Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
 But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:
Burthen.Ding-dong. The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business, nor no sound
That the earth owes.   I hear it now above me.

 Most sure, the goddess
On whom these airs attend!   Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my prime request,
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
If you be maid or no?

 My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech,
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

 A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples.   He does hear me:
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
The king my father wreck'd.

 Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain.

 O, if a virgin,
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
The queen of Naples.

 No, as I am a man,

 No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.

[Draws, and is charmed from moving.
 So they are;
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
Might I but through my prison once a day
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.

 There be some sports are painful, and their labour
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
Most busy lest, when I do it.

    Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen.
 O most dear mistress,
The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do.

 No, precious creature;
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
Than you should such dishonour undergo,
While I sit lazy by.

 No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me
When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
What is your name?

 Admired Miranda!
Indeed the top of admiration!   worth
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard and many a time.
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
Have I liked several women; never any
With so full soul, but some defect in her
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
So perfect and so peerless, are created
Of every creature's best!

 I am in my condition
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
I would, not so!--and would no more endure
This wooden slavery than to suffer
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you, did
My heart fly to your service: there resides,
To make me slave to it; and for your sake
Am I this patient log-man.

 O heaven, O   earth, bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
What best is boded me to mischief!   I
Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
Do love, prize, honour you.

 Wherefore weep you?

 My mistress, dearest;
And I thus humble ever.

 Ay, with a heart as willing
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.

 A thousand thousand!

[Exeunt Fer. and Mir. severally.
 I do believe it
Against an oracle.

 As I hope
For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion
Our worser genius can, shall never melt
Mine honour into lust, to take away
The edge of that day's celebration
When I shall think, or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
Or Night kept chain'd below.

 I warrant you, sir;
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Abates the ardour of my liver.

 This is a most majestic vision, and
Harmonious charmingly.   May I be bold
To think these spirits?

 Let me live here ever;
So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
Makes this place Paradise.

[Juno and Ceres whisper, and send
Iris on employment.
 This is strange: your father's in some passion
That works him strongly.

 We wish your peace.

 No, my dear'st love,
I would not for the world.

 Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
I have cursed them without cause. [Kneels.
 Sir, she is mortal;
But by immortal Providence she's mine:
I chose her when I could not ask my father
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan
Of whom so often I have heard renown,
But never saw before; of whom I have
Received a second life; and second father
This lady makes him to me.

"
67,par.,PARIS,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-par.," Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

 Younger than she are happy mothers made.

 These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

 Monday, my lord.

 My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

 My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

 Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society:
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

 Happily met, my lady and my wife!

 That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

 Come you to make confession to this father?

 Do not deny to him that you love me.

 So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

 Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

 Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

 Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

 God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

Exit.
 Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

 Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
Most detestable death, by thee beguiled,
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!

 Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging   up   of graves,
But thou shalt hear it; whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

 Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The Page whistles.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
What, with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
Retires.
Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, &c.
 This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
It is supposed, the fair creature died;
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.

Comes forward.
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

 I do defy thy conjurations,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

 O, I am slain! Falls.
If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Dies.
"
68,cal.,CALIBAN,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-cal.," There's wood enough within.

 As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!

 I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me.   When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in 't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
For I am all the subjects that you have,
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
The rest o' the island.

 O ho, O ho! would 't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.

 You taught me language; and my profit on 't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!

 No, pray thee.
[Aside]I must obey: his art is of such power,
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
And make a vassal of him.

 All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' the mire,
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
For every trifle are they set upon me;
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me.
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.

Enter TRINCULO.
Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
Perchance he will not mind me.

        I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.

 I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.

 I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.

 I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
Thou wondrous man.

 I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

  No more dams I'll make for fish; Nor fetch in firing
At requiring;
Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish:
'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
Has a new master: get a new man.
 How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he is not valiant.

        Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.

 What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.

  Beat him enough: after a little time
I'll beat him too.

 Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
Having first seized his books, or with a log
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
First to possess his books; for without them
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
One spirit to command: they all do hate him
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,--
Which, when he has a house, he'll deck withal.
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter; he himself
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
But only Sycorax my dam and she;
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
As great'st does least.

 Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
And bring thee forth brave brood.

 Within this half hour will he be asleep:
Wilt thou destroy him then?

 Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
You taught me but while-ere?

 That 's not the tune.

[Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe.
  Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises.
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open and show riches
Ready to drop upon me, that, when I waked,
I cried to dream again.

  Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.

 Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
All's hush'd as midnight yet.

 Prithee, my king, be quiet.   See'st thou here,
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
For aye thy foot-licker.

  The dropsy drown this fool! what do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
And do the murder first: if he awake,
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
Make us strange stuff.

 I will have none on 't: we shall lose our time,
And all be turned to barnacles, or to apes
With foreheads villanous low,

 O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
How fine my master is! I am afraid
He will chastise me.

 I shall be pinch'd to death.

 Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
And seek for grace.   What a thrice-double ass
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
And worship this dull fool!

"
69,ant.,ANTIGONUS,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-ant.," Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
Yourself, your queen, your son.

 If it prove
She's otherwise,   I'll keep my stables where
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world,
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false,
If she be.

 It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
You are abused and by some putter-on
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
I would land-damn him. Be she honor-flaw'd,
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven;
The second and the third, nine, and some five;
If this prove true, they'll pay for't: by mine honor,
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.

 If it be so,
We need no grave to bury honesty:
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.

 And I wish, my liege.
You had only in your silent judgement tried it,
Without more overture.

 [Aside] To laughter, as I take it,
If the good truth were known.
[Exeunt. That's enough.

 I told her so, my lord,
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
She should not visit you.

 La you now, you hear:
When she will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.

 I am none, by this good light.

 Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
Hardly one subject.

 I did not, sir;
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
Can clear me in't.

 Any thing, my lord,
That my ability may undergo
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
To save the innocent: any thing possible.

 I will, my lord.

 I swear to do this, though a present death
Had been more merciful.   Come on, poor babe:
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses!   Wolves and bears, they say,
Casting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
In more than this deed does require! And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!
[Exit with the child.
 Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
The deserts of Bohemia?

 Their sacred wills be done!   Go, get aboard;
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
I call upon thee.

 Go thou away:
I'll follow instantly.

 Come, poor babe:
I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o' the dead
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
Like very sanctity, she did approach
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
Did this break from her: 'Good Antigonus,
Since fate, against thy better disposition,
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks,
She melted into air. Affrighted much,
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
I will be squared by this. I do believe
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
Either for life or death, upon the earth
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
There lie, and there thy character: there these;
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
And still rest thine. The storm begins: poor wretch,
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
To loss and what may follow!   Weep I cannot,
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamor!
Well may I get aboard!   This is the chase:
I am gone for ever.
[Exit, pursued by a bear.
                Enter a Shepherd.
"
70,bra.,BRABANTIO,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/oth.xml-bra.," What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there?

 Why, wherefore ask you this?

 What, have you lost your wits?

 Not I: what are you?

 The worser welcome:
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
To start my quiet.

 But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee.

 What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
My house is not a grange.

  Thou art a villain.

 This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

 Strike on the tinder, ho!
Give me a taper! call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream:
Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say! light!
[Exit above.
 It is too true an evil: gone she is;
And what's to come of my despised time
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
Where didst thou see her?   O unhappy girl!
With the Moor, say'st thou?   Who would be a father!
How didst thou know 'twas she?   O, she deceives me
Past thought!   What said she to you?   Get more tapers:
Raise all my kindred.   Are they married, think you?

 O heaven!   How got she out?   O treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
By what you see them act. Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May he abused?   Have you not read, Roderigo,
Of some such thing?

 Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
Some one way, some another. Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

 Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
And raise some special officers of night.
On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.
[Exeunt.
 Down with him, thief!
[They draw on both sides.
 O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
If she in chains of magic were not bound,
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world, a practiser
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
Subdue him at his peril.

 To prison, till fit time
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer.

 How! the duke in council!
In this time of the night! Bring him away:
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
Or any of my brothers of the state,
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
For if such actions may have passage free,
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
[Exeunt. 
 So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
Take hold on me, for my particular grief
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
And it is still itself.

 My daughter! O, my daughter!

 Ay, to me;
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
For nature so preposterously to err,
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
Sans witchcraft could not.

 Humbly I thank your grace.
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
Your special mandate for the state-affairs
Hath hither brought.

 Nothing, but this is so.

 A maiden never bold;
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
It is a judgement maim'd and most imperfect
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
To find out practices of cunning hell,
Why this should be.   I therefore vouch again
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
He wrought upon her.

 I pray you, hear her speak:
If she confess that she was half the wooer,
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
Light on the man!   Come hither, gentle mistress:
Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience?

 God be wi' you! I have done.
Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Come hither, Moor:
I here do give thee that with all my heart
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
I am glad at soul I have no other child;
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
To hang clogs on them.   I have done, my lord.

 So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
But words are words; I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

 I'll not have it so.

 Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
She has deceived her father, and may thee.
[Exeunt Duke, Senators, Officers, &c.
"
71,nest.,NESTOR,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-nest.," With due observance of thy godlike seat,
Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
Thy latest words.   In the reproof of chance
Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
How many shallow bauble boasts dare sail
Upon her patient breast, making their way
With those of nobler bulk!
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut, 
Bounding between the two moist elements,
Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
Co-rivall'd greatness?   Either to harbor fled,
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
Doth valor's show and valor's worth divide
In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks, 
And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
As roused with rage doth sympathize,
And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
Retorts to chiding fortune. Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
The fever whereof all our power is sick. And in the imitation of these twain--
Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
With an imperial voice--many are infect.
Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
In such a rein, in full as proud a place
As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him; 
Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
To match us in comparisons with dirt,
To weaken and discredit our exposure,
How rank soever rounded in with danger. Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
Makes many Thetis' sons.
[A tucket.  Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man 
When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
But if there be not in our Grecian host
One noble man that hath one spark of fire,
To answer for his love, tell him from me
I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
And meeting him will tell him that my lady
Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood. What says Ulysses? What is't? Well, and how?          The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,
Whose grossness little characters sum up:
And, in the publication, make no strain,
But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,
'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgement,
Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose   
Pointing on him. Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
That can from Hector bring his honor off,
If not Achilles?   Though't be a sportful combat,
Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
Our imputation shall be oddly poised
In this wild action; for the success,        
Although particular, shall give a scantling
Of good or bad unto the general;
And in such indexes, although small pricks
To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
The baby figure of the giant mass
Of things to come at large.   It is supposed
He that meets Hector issues from our choice;
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
As 'twere from forth us all, a man distill'd 
Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
In no less working than are swords and bows
Directive by the limbs. I see them not with my old eyes: what are they? Ulysses,Now I begin to relish thy advice;
And I will give a taste of it forthwith
To Agamemnon: go we to him straight. 
Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.
[Exeunt.       Yet he loves himself:   is't not strange?               
[Aside.
                Re-enter ULYSSES. [Aside to Dio.] O, this is well; he rubs the vein of him.      Wherefore should you so?
He is not emulous, as Achilles is. What a vice were it in Ajax now,-- Ay, my good son. Would you, my lord, aught with the general? Nothing, my lord.                   Our general doth salute you with a kiss. And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.So much for Nestor. A woman of quick sense. How, Ajax, hold thine own! I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
Laboring for destiny make cruel way
Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
Despising many forfeits and subduements,
When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
Not letting it decline on the declined,
That I have said to some my standers by 
'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;
But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
Never like thee.   Let an old man embrace thee;
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.  I would my arms could match thee in contention,
As they contend with thee in courtesy. Ha!By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee tomorrow.
Well, welcome, welcome!--I have seen the time.  Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles;
And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
There is a thousand Hectors in the field:
Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,   
And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:
Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,
Dexterity so obeying appetite
That what he will he does, and does so much
That proof is call'd impossibility.
                 Enter ULYSSES. So, so, we draw together.
                Enter ACHILLES. Peace, drums!

72,ant.,ANTIOCHUS,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/per.xml-ant.," Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
The danger of the task you undertake. Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
For the embracements even of Jove himself;
At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
The senate-house of planets all did sit,   
To knit in her their best perfections.
Music. Enter the Daughter of Antiochus. Prince Pericles,-- Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view 
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
And which, without desert, because thine eye
Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
That without covering, save yon field of stars,
Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
For going on death's net, whom none resist.  Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:
Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed. Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,
For that's an article within our law,
As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
Either expound now, or receive your sentence. Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found the meaning:
But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,              
Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
Your exposition misinterpreting,
We might proceed to cancel of your days;
Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
Forty days longer we do respite you;
If by which time our secret be undone,
This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
And until then your entertain shall be
As doth befit our honour and your worth. 
[Exeunt all but Pericles. He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
To have his head.
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
In such a loathed manner;
And therefore instantly this prince must die;
For by his fall my honour must keep high.
Who attends us there?
                Enter THALIARD. Thaliard,
You are of our chamber, and our mind par- takes
Her private actions to your secrecy;
And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
Because we bid it. Say, is it done? Enough.                             
              Enter a Messenger.
Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste. As thou
Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot
From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return
Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.' Thaliard, adieu!  [Exit Thal.] Till
Pericles be dead, 
My heart can lend no succour to my head.

 It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
And I believe 'twill never stand upright
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.

 Ay, my good lord.

 Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
Upon his party for the gain thereof:
And thereupon he sends you this good news,
That this same very day your enemies,
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

 God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!

 What, my lord?

 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
When men are unrpepared and look not for it.

 The princes both make high account of you;
[Aside]For they account his head upon the bridge.

 My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
To visit him to-morrow or next day:
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
Divinely bent to meditation;
And in no worldly suit would he be moved,
To draw him from his holy exercise.

 I'll tell him what you say, my lord.

Such troops of citizens to speak with him,

My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.

 O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!

 Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.

 Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

 Here, my lord.

 First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.

 I go.[Exit
 My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

 It's supper-time, my lord;
It's nine o'clock.

 It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.

 My lord?

 Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger:
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD.
 Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.

74,ghost.,Ghost of Hamlet's Father,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ham.xml-ghost.," Mark me.

 My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.

 Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.

 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

 I am thy father's spirit,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine: 
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love—

 Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

 Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.

 I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused; but know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.

 Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,—
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline 
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
And prey on garbage.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom always of the afternoon,   
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; 
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unaneled,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head:
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!   
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her.   Fare thee well at once!
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:      
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
Exit.
 Swear.

 Swear.

 Swear.

 Swear.

 Do not forget: this visitation   
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Speak to her, Hamlet.

And with my hand, I seal my true heart's love.

 And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!

 Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?

 Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him;
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF.
 Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?

 And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach,
Which haply by much company might be urged:
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

 Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

 O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.

 Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God,
To hear her prayers for them, as now for us!
And for my sister and her princely sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

 Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.
                                 [Exeunt."
76,sec.-sen.,Second Senator,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-sec.-sen.," Most true; the law shall bruise him.
Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants. 
 You breathe in vain.

 He has made too much plenty with 'em;
He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:
If there were no foes, that were enough
To overcome him: in that beastly fury
He has been known to commit outrages,
And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

 How!

 At all times alike
Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,
Offering the fortunes of his former days,
The former man may make him. Bring us to him,
And chance it as it may.

 They confess
Toward the forgetfulness too general, gross:
Which now the public body, which doth seldom
Play the recanter, feeling in itself
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
Of it own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,
Together with a recompense more fruitful
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
And write in thee the figures of their love,
Ever to read them thine.

 And shakes his threatening sword
Against the walls of Athens.

 And enter in our ears like great triumphers
In their applauding gates.

 Our hope in him is dead: let us return,
And strain what other means is left unto us
In our dear peril.

 We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.

 So did we woo
Transformed Timon to our city's love
By humble message and by promised means:
We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
The common stroke of war.

 Nor are they living
Who were the motives that you first went out;
Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess
Hath broke their hearts.   March, noble lord,
Into our city with thy banners spread:
By decimation, and a tithed death--
If thy revenges hunger for that food
Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,
And by the hazard of the spotted die
Let die the spotted.

 What thou wilt,
Thou rather shalt enforce with thy smile
Than hew to 't with thy sword.

 Throw thy glove,
Or any token of thine honour else,
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
And not as our confusion, all thy powers
Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
Have seal'd thy full desire.

"
77,prov.,PROVOST,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-prov.," I do it not in evil disposition,
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

  Here, if it like your honour.

 Pray you, do. [Exit Servant.] I'll know
His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
He hath but as offended in a dream!
All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
To die for't!
                 Enter ANGELO.
 Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

 Lest I might be too rash:
Under your good correction. I have seen,
When, after execution, judgement hath
Repented o'er his doom.

 I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
She's very near her hour.

 Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
If not already.

 God save your honour!

 Heaven give thee moving graces!

 Pray heaven she win him!

 I am the provost.   What's your will, good friar?

 I would do more than that, if more were needed.
                 Enter JULIET.
Look here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
More fit to do another such office
Than die tor this.

 As I do think, to-morrow,
I have provided for you: stay awhile, [To Juliet.]
And you shall be conducted.

 'Tis pity of him. [Exeunt.
 Who's there?  come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

 And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.

 As many as you please.

            The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
                Enter CLAUDIO.
Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?

 Who can do good on him?
Well, go, prepare yourself. [Knocking within.
But, hark, what noise?
Heaven give your spirits comfort!   [Exit Claudio.
By and by.
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio. Enter DUKE disguised as before.
Welcome, father.

 None, since the curfew rung.

 No.

 What comfort is for Claudio?

 It is a bitter deputy.

 There he must stay until the officer
Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

 None, sir, none.

 Happily
You something know; yet I believe there comes
No countermand; no such example have we:
Besides, upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Profess'd the contrary.
             Enter a MESSENGER.
This is his lordship's man.

              But what likelihood is in that?

 I know them both.

 Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

 Here in the prison, father,
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

 This shall be done, good father, presently.
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall we continue Claudio,
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive?

 I am your free dependant.

 Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

 I'll make all speed.
[Exit.
 It was commanded so.

 No, my good lord; it was by private message.

 Pardon me, noble lord:
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
Yet did repent me, after more advice:
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
That should by private order else have died,
I have reserved alive.

 His name is Barnardine.

                           This, my lord.

 This is another prisoner that I saved,
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself.

[Unmuffles Claudio.
"
78,tim.,TIMON of Athens,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tim.xml-tim.," Imprison'd is he, say you?

 Noble Ventidius!   Well;
I am not of that feather to shake off
My friend when he must need me. I do know him
A gentleman that well deserves a help:
Which he shall have:  I'll pay the debt, and free him.

 Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
But to support him after. Fare you well.

 Freely, good father.

 I have so: what of him?

 Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!

 Well; what further?

 The man is honest.

 Does she love him?

 Love you the maid?

 How shall she be endow'd,
If she be mated with an equal husband?

 This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
To build his fortune I will strain a little,
For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
And make him weigh with her.

 My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.

 I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
Go not away. What have you there, my friend ?

 Painting is welcome.
The painting is almost the natural man;
For since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
Even such as they give out. I like your work;
And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
Till you hear further from me.

 Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand:
We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
Hath suffer'd under praise.

 A mere satiety of commendations.
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
It would unclew me quite.

 Well mock'd.

 Look, who comes here: will you be chid?
Enter APEMANTUS.
 Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!

 Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.

 Yes.

 Thou art proud, Apemantus.

             What trumpet's that?

 Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.
[Exeunt some Attendants. 
You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest.
Most welcome, sir!

 Right welcome, sir!
Ere we depart, we 'll share a bounteous time
In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.

[Exeunt all except Apemantus.
Enter two Lords.
 O, by no means,
Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:
I gave it freely ever; and there's none
Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.

 Nay, my lords,

[They all stand ceremoniously looking on Timon.
Ceremony was but devised at first
To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
Than my fortunes to me.
[They sit.
 O, Apemantus, you are welcome.

 Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye 've got a humour there
  My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.

    What means that trump?
Enter a Servant.
How now?

 Ladies! what are their wills?

  They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:
Music, make their welcome!
[Exit Cupid.
 You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
Which was not half so beautiful and kind;
You have added worth unto 't and lustre,
And entertain'd me with mine own device;
I am to thank you for 't.

 Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:
Please you to dispose yourselves.

 Flavius.

 The little casket bring me hither.

 O my friends,
I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,
I must entreat you, honour me so much
As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
Kind my lord.

 They are fairly welcome.

 Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:
I prithee, let's be provided to show the entertainment.

 I shall accept them fairly; let the presents
Be worthily entertain'd.
Enter a third Servant.
How now! what news?

 I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
Not without fair reward.

 You do yourselves
Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:
Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.

 And now I remember, my lord, you gave
Good words the other day of a bay courser
I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.

 You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man
Can justly praise but what he does affect:
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;
I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.

 I take all and your several visitations
So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich:
It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living
Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
Lie in a pitch'd field.

 And so
Am I to you.

 All to you. Lights, more lights!

 Ready for his friends.

[Exeunt all but Apemantus and Timon.
 Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen,
I would be good to thee.

  So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,
My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?

 Dues!  Whence are you?

 Go to my steward.

 Mine honest friend,
I prithee, but repair to me next morning.

 Contain thyself, good friend.

 Give me breath.
I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
I'll wait upon you instantly.

[Exeunt Alcibiades and Lords.
 [To Flav.]
Come hither: pray you.
How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd
With clamorous demands of date-broke bonds,
And the detention of long-since-due debts,
Against my honour?

 Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd.
[Exit. 
 You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time
Had you not fully laid my state before me,
That I might so have rated my expense,
As I had leave of means?

 Go to:
Perchance some single vantages you took,
When my indisposition put you back;
And that unaptness made your minister,
Thus to excuse yourself.

 Let all my land be sold.

 To Lacedaemon did my land extend.

 You tell me true.

 Prithee, no more.

 Come, sermon me no further;
No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
Why dost thou weep?   Canst thou the conscience lack,
To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
If I would broach the vessels of my love,
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
As I can bid thee speak.

 And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,
That I account them blessings; for by these
Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.
Within there!   Flaminius! Servilius!
Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other
Servants.
  Go you, sir, to the senators--
Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have
Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant
A thousand talents to me.

 Is 't true? can 't be?

 You gods, reward them!
Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.
[To a Serv.]
Go to Ventidius.
[To Flav.] Prithee, be not sad, 
Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak,
No blame belongs to thee. [To Ser.]
Ventidius lately
Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd
Into a great estate: when he was poor,
Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,
I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;
Bid him suppose some good necessity
Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd
With those five talents [Exit Serv.]
.
[To Flav.] That had, give't these fellows 
To whom 'tis instant due.   Ne'er speak, or think,
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.

 What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
Have I been ever free, and must my house
Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
The place which I have feasted, does it now,
Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?

      They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
Creditors? devils!

   So fitly?   Go, bid all my friends again.
Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:
All, sirrah, all:
I'll once more feast the rascals.

 Be 't not in thy care; go,
I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide
Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
[Exeunt.
         May you a better feast never behold,
You knot of mouth-friends! smoke and lukewarm water
Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces
Your reeking villany.

Throwing the water in their faces.
Live loathed and long,
Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,
You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,
Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minutejacks!
Of man and beast the infinite malady
Crust you quite o'er!   What, dost thou go?
Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--
Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.

[Throws the dishes at them, and drives
                                      them out.
What, all in motion?   Henceforth   be no feast,
Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be
Of Timon man and all humanity!
Exit.
Re-enter the Lords, Senators, &c. 
 Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,
And fence not Athens!   Matrons, turn incontinent!
Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from   the bench,
And minister in their steads! to general filths
Convert o' the instant, green virginity,
Do't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;
Rather than render back, out with your knives,
And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
Thy mistress is o' the brothel!   Son of sixteen,
Pluck the lined crutch from   thy old limping sire,
With it beat out his brains!   Piety, and fear,
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
Decline to your confounding contraries.
And let confusion live!  Plagues, incident to men,
Your potent and infectious fevers heap
On Athens, ripe for stroke!   Thou cold sciatica,
Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
As lamely as their manners!   Lust and liberty
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
That 'gainst the stream   of virtue they may strive,
And drown themselves in riot!   Itches, blains,
Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop
Be general leprosy!   Breath infect breath,
That their society, as their friendship, may
Be merely poison!   Nothing I'll bear from thee,
But nakedness, thou detestable town!
Take thou that too, with multiplying bans
Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--
The Athenians both within and out that wall!
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
To the whole race of mankind, high and low!
Amen.
[Exit.
 O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
Infect the air!   Twinn'd   brothers of one womb,
Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortunes;
But thy contempt of nature.
Raise me this beggar, and deny't that lord;
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
The beggar native honour.
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
In purity of manhood stand upright,
And say 'This man's a flatterer'? if one be,
So are they all; for every grise of fortune
Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:
Destruction fang mankind!   Earth, yield me roots!
[Digging.
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
With thy most operant poison! What is here?
Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold?   No, gods,
I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods?   Why, this
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
Pluck stout men's pillows from   below   their heads:
This yellow slave
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
And give them title, knee and approbation
With senators on the bench: this is it
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds
Among the rout of nations, I will make thee
Do thy right nature. [March afar off.]
Ha! a drum?   Thou'rt quick,
But yet I'll bury thee: thou 'lt go, strong thief,
When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
Nay, stay thou out for earnest.

[Keeping some gold.
Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in
  warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA.
 A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
For showing me again the eyes of man!

 I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
That I might love thee something.

 I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,
I desire not to know. Follow thy drum;
With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:
Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;
Then what should war be?   This fell whore of thine
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
For all her cherubin look.

 I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
To thine own lips again.

 As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
But then renew I could not, like the moon;
There were no suns to borrow of.

 None, but to
Maintain my opinion.

  Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.

 As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.

 Art thou Timandra?

 Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;
Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
To the tub-fast and the diet.

 I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.

 How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
I had rather be alone.

 Keep it, I cannot eat it.

 Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?

 The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!

 That, by killing of villains,
Thou wast born to conquer my country.
Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;
Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
It is her habit only that is honest,
Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,
That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay thy soldiers:
Make large confusion: and thy fury spent,
Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.

 Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse upon thee!

 Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,--
Although, I know, you'll swear, terribly swear
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths.
I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,
No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face:
A pox of wrinkles!

 Consumptions sow
In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
That he may never more false title plead,
Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
That scolds against the quality of flesh,
And not believes himself: down with the nose,
Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
Of him that, his particular to foresee,
Smells from the general weal: make curl'dpate ruffians bald;
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
Derive some pain from you: plague all;
That your activity may defeat and quell
The source of all erection. There's more gold:
Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
And ditches grave you all!

 More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.

 If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.

 Yes, thou spokest well of me.

 Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
Thy beagles with thee.

 That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,
[Digging.
Whose womb unmeasurable, and   infinite breast,
Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,
Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
Whereon Hyperion's quickening   fire doth shine;
Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
Teem   with new monsters, whom thy upward face
Hath to the marbled mansion all above
Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
Whereof ingrateful   man,   with   liquorish draughts
And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
That from it all consideration slips!
Enter APEMANTUS.
More man? plague, plague!

 'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
Whom   I would imitate: consumption catch thee!

 Were I like thee, I 'ld throw away myself.

 A fool of thee: depart.

 I hate thee worse.

 Thou flatter'st misery.

 Why dost thou seek me out?

 Always a villain's office or a fool's.
Dost please thyself in 't?

 What! a knave too?

 Not by his breath that is more miserable.
Thou art a slave, whom fortune's tender arm
With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
Hadst thou, like us from   our first swath, proceeded
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
To such as may the passive drugs of it
Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself
In general riot; melted down thy youth
In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
Who had the world as my confectionary,
The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
At duty, more than I could frame employment,
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
Do on the oak, have with one winter's brush
Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,
That never knew but better, is some burden:
Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given ?
If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
To some she beggar and compounded thee
Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.

 Ay, that I am not thee.

 I, that I am one now:
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
I'd give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
That the whole life of Athens were in this!
Thus would I eat it.
[Eating a root.
 First mend my company, take away thyself.

 'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;
If not, I would it were.

 Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.

 The best and truest;
For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.

 Under that's above me,
Where feedest thou o' days, Apemantus?

            Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!

 All villains that do stand by thee are pure.

 If I name thee.
I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.

 Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
I swound to see thee.

 Away,
Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
A stone by thee.
[Throws a stone at him.
 Slave !

 Rogue, rogue, rogue!
I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
But even the mere necessities upon 't.
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
[To the gold]
O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
That solder'st close impossibilities,
And makest them  kiss! that speak'st with every tongue,
To every purpose!   O thou touch of hearts!
Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
May have the world in empire!

 Throng'd to

 Thy back, I prithee.

 Long live so, and so die.   [Exit Apemantus.
I am quit.
Moe things like men!   Eat, Timon, and abhor them.
Enter Banditti.
   Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
Why should you want?   Behold, the earth hath roots;
Within this mile break   forth a hundred springs;
The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?

 Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
In limited professions.   Rascal thieves,
Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
His antidotes are poison, and he slays
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
Do villany, do, since you protest to do 't,
Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery:
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
Have uncheck'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
Break open shops; nothing can you steal,
But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
I give you; and gold confound you whosoe'er!
Amen.

 Away! what art thou?

 Why dost ask that?   I have forgot all men;
Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.

 Then I know thee not:
I never had honest man about me, I; all
I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.

 What, dost thou weep?   Come nearer. Then I love thee,
Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!

 Had I a steward
So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
Was born of woman.
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
One honest man-mistake me not-but one;
No more, I pray,-and he's a steward.
How fain would I have hated all mankindl
And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
I fell with curses.
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
For, by oppressing and betraying me,
Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
For many so arrive at second masters,
Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--
Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
Expecting in return twenty for one?

 Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
Here, ake: the gods out of my misery
Have sent thee treasure.   Go, live rich and happy;
But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
Debts wither 'em   to nothing; be men like blasted woods,
And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
And so farewell and thrive.

 If thou hatest curses,
Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:
Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.

[Exit Flavius.   Timon retires to his cave.
   I'll meet you at the turn. What a god's gold,
That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
Than where swine feed!
'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
Settlest admired reverence in a slave:
To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey
Fit I meet them.
[Coming forward.
 Have I once lived to see two honest men ?

 Let it go naked, men may see 't the better:
You that are honest, by being what you are,
Make them best seen and known.

 Ay, you are honest men.

 Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.

 Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;
I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.

 Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;
Thou counterfeit'st most lively.

 E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,
Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
That thou art even natural in thine art.
But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,
I must needs say you have a little fault:
Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
You take much pains to mend.

 You'll take it ill.

 Will you, indeed?

 There's never one of you but trusts a knave,
That mightily deceives you.

 Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured
That he's a made-up villain.

 Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
Rid me these villains from your companies:
Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
Confound them by some course, and come to me,
I'll give you gold enough.

 You that way and you this, but two in company;
Each man apart, all single and alone,
Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
If where thou art two villains shall not be,
Come not near him.   If thou wouldst not reside
But where one villain is, then him abandon.
Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:
[To Painter]
You have work'd for me; there 's payment for you: hence!
 [To Poet]
You are an alchemist; make gold of that.
Out, rascal dogs!
Beats them out, and then retires to his cave.
Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators.
 Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and be hang'd:
For each true word, a blister! and each false
Be as a cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,
Consuming it with speaking!

 Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.

 I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
Could I but catch it for them.

 You witch me in it;
Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.

 Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
That Timon cares not.   But if he sack fair Athens,
And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
Giving our holy virgins to the stain
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war
Then let him know, and tell him   Timon speaks it,
In pity of our aged and our youth,
I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
While you have throats to answer: for myself,
There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
But I do prize it at my love before
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
To the protection of the prosperous gods,
As thieves to keepers.

 Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
It will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
Of health and living now begins to mend,
And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
And last so long enough!

 But yet I love my country, and am not
One that rejoices in the common wreck,
As common bruit doth put it.

 Commend me to my loving countrymen,--

 Commend me to them,
And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.

 I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
That mine own use invites me to cut down,
And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,
Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree
From   high   to low   throughout, that whoso please
To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.

 Come not to me again: but say to Athens,
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
Who once a day with his embossed froth
The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
What is amiss plague and infection mend!
Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
Sun, hide thy beams!   Timon hath done his reign.
[Retires to his cave. 
"
79,d.-pedro.,DON PEDRO,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ado.xml-d.-pedro.,"         By my troth, I speak my thought.

         My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.

 No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?

 Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
And I will break with her and with her father,
And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?

 What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
Look, what will serve is fit; 'tis once, thou lovest,
And I will fit thee with the remedy.
I know we shall have revelling to-night:
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
Then after to her father will I break;
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practice let us put it presently.
                          [Exeunt.
                      By my troth, a pleasant-spirited
lady.

     And you too, gentle Hero?

   See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

 Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.

 It is the witness still of excellency
To put a strange face on his own perfection.
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.

 Now, pray thee, come;
Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
Do it in notes.

 Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.  [Air. 
 By my troth, a good song.

    May be she doth but counterfeit.

 Why, what effects of passion shows she?

                                Why, what's the matter?

   O day untowardly turned!

 Nothing, unless you render her again.

 What should I speak?
I stand dishonor'd, that have gone about
To link my dear friend to a common stale.

 Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honor,
Myself, my brother and this grieved count
Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
A thousand times in secret.

 Good den, good den.

 We have some haste, Leonato.

 Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.

 You say not right, old man.

 Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
But, on my honor, she was charged with nothing
But what was true and very full of proof.

 I will not hear you.

 See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
Enter BENEDICK.
      What, a feast, a feast?

    He is in earnest.

        Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?

 But did my brother set thee on to this?

 He is composed and framed of treachery:
And fled he is upon this villany.

 By my soul, nor I:
And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
I would bend under any heavy weight
That he'll enjoin me to.

 We will not fail.

 Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.

 Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
And then to Leonato's we will go.

 Good morrow to this fair assembly.

 Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
That you have such a February face,
So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?

 The former Hero! Hero that is dead!

 "
80,gon.,GONZALO,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-gon.,"     The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them.
For our case is as theirs.


 He'll be hang'd yet,
Though every drop of water swear against it
And gape at widest to glut him.

[A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'--
'We split, we split!'--'Farewell my wife and children!'--
'Farewell, brother'--'We split, we split, we split!']
  Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
I mean our preservation, few in millions
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort,

                  My lord Sebastian,
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
When you should bring the plaster.

 It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
When you are cloudy.

 Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

 And were the king on 't, what would I do?

 I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty.
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
No occupation; all men idle, all;
And women too, but innocent and pure;
No sovereignty;--

 All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
Of it own kind, all foison, all abundance,
To feed my innocent people.

 I would with such perfection govern, sir,
To excel the golden age.

         And,--do you mark me, sir?

     Now, good angels
Preserve the king. [They wake.
 What's the matter?

 Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
Or that we quit this place: let's draw our weapons.

 Heavens keep him from these beasts!
For he is, sure, i' the island.

 By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
I needs must rest me.

  If in Naples
I should report this now, would they believe me?
If I should say, I saw such islanders--
For, certes, these are people of the island--
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
Our human generation you shall find
Many, nay, almost any.

 Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
Who would believe that there were mountaineers
Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
Good warrant of.

 I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
In this strange stare?

 All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
Like poison given to work a great time after,
Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
May now provoke them to.

 All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
Out of this fearful country!

 Whether this be
Or be not, I'll not swear.

 I have inly wept
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,
And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
Which brought us hither.

 Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
Should become kings of Naples?   O, rejoice
Beyond a common joy, and set it down
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own.

 Be it so! Amen!

 Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following.
O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
Hast thou no mouth by land?   What is the news?

"
81,nor.,DUKE OF NORFOLK,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-nor.," I thank your grace,
Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer
Of what I saw there.

 'Twixt Guynes and Arde:
I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;
Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung
In their embracement, as they grew together;
Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd
Such a compounded one?

 Then you lost
The view of earthly glory: men might say,
Till this time pomp was single, but now married
To one above itself. Each following day
Became the next day's master, till the last
Made former wonders its.   To-day the French,
All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they
Made Britain India: every man that stood
Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
As cherubins, all gilt: the madams too,
Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
The pride upon them, that their very labour
Was to them as a painting: now this masque
Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night
Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
As presence did present them; him in eye,
Still him in praise: and, being present both,
Twas said they saw   but one; and no discerner
Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged
The noble spirits to arms, they did perform
Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,
Being now seen possible enough, got credit,
That Bevis was believed.

 As I belong to worship and affect
In honour honesty, the tract of every thing
Would by a good discourser lose some life,
Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;
To the disposing of it nought rebell'd,
Order gave each thing view; the office did
Distinctly his full function.

 One, certes, that promises no element
In such a business.

 All this was order'd by the good discretion
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.

 Surely, sir,
There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace
Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon
For high feats done to the crown; neither allied
To eminent assistants; but, spider-like,
Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,
The force of his own merit makes his way;
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys
A place next to the king.

 Grievingly I think,
The peace between the French and us not values
The cost that did conclude it.

 Which is budded out;
For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd
Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.

 Marry, is't.

 Like it your grace,
The state takes notice of the private difference
Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Honour and plenteous safety--that you read
The cardinal's malice and his potency
Together; to consider further that
What his high hatred would effect wants not
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
That he's revengeful, and I know his sword
Math a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,
It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,
You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
That I advise your shunning.
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne
 before him, certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with papers.
The CARDINAL in his passage fixeth his eye on BUCKINGHAM,
and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdain.
 What, are you chafed?
Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only
Which your disease requires.

 Stay, my lord,
And let your reason with your choler question
What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
Requires slow pace at first: anger is like
A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
Can advise me like you: be to yourself
As you would to your friend.

 Be advised;
Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,
By violent swiftness, that which we run at,
And lose by over-running. Know you not,
That fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er,
In seeming to augment it wastes it?   Be advised:
I say again, there is no English soul
More stronger to direct you than yourself,
If with the sap of reason you would quench,
Or but allay, the fire of passion.

 Say not 'treasonous.'

 Faith, and so it did.

 I am sorry
To hear this of him; and could wish he were
Something mistaken in't.

 Not almost appears,
It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,
The clothiers all, not able to maintain
The many to them 'longing, have put off
The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,
Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger
And lack of other means, in desperate manner
Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,
And danger serves among them.

 Well met, my lord chamberlain.

 What's the cause?

 'Tis so:
This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:
That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,
Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.

 How holily he works in all his business!
And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league
Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,
He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters
Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,
Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:
And out of all these to restore the king,
He counsels a divorce; a loss of her
That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years
About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;
Of her that loves him with that excellence
That angels love good men with; even of her
That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?

 We had need pray,
And heartily, for our deliverance;
Or this imperious man will work us all
From princes into pages: all men's honours
Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd
Into what pitch he please.

 Let's in;
And with some other business put the king
From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:
My lord, you'll bear us company?

 Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.

Exit Lord Chamberlain; and the
 King draws the curtain, and sits reading pensively. 
 Pray God he be not angry.

 A gracious king that pardons all offences
Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way
Is business of estate; in which we come
To know your royal pleasure.

 This priest has no pride in him?

 If it do,
I'll venture one have-at-him.

 If you will now unite in your complaints,
And force them with a constancy, the cardinal
Cannot stand under them: if you omit
The offer of this time, I cannot promise
But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,
With these you bear already.

 O, fear him not;
His spell in that is out: the king hath found
Matter against him that for ever mars
The honey of his language. No, he's settled,
Not to come off, in his displeasure.

 Believe it, this is true:
In the divorce his contrary proceedings
Are all unfolded; wherein he appears
As I would wish mine enemy.

 All men's!

 Marry, amen!

 But, my lord,
When returns Cranmer?

 This same Cranmer's
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
In the king's business.

 So I hear.

 Observe, observe, he's moody.

 He's discontented.

 He is vex'd at something.

 My lord, we have
Stood here observing him; some strange commotion
Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;
Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
Then lays his finger on his temple; straight
Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,
Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts
His eye against the moon: in most strange postures
We have seen him set himself.

 It's heaven's will:
Some spirit put this paper in the packet,
To bless your eye withal.

 Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you
To render up the great seal presently
Into our hands; and to confine yourself
To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,
Till you hear further from his highness.

 Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:
But, thus much, they are foul ones.

 Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else
To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'
Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king
To be your servant.

 And so we'll leave you to your meditations
How to live better. For your stubborn answer
About the giving back the great seal to us,
The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.

Exeunt all but Wolsey.
 Who waits there?

 Do you think, my lords,
The king will suffer but the little finger
Of this man to be vex'd?

"
82,lucio.,LUCIO,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mm.xml-lucio.,"                Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

    A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
Is lechery so look'd after?

 With child, perhaps?

   Within two hours.

 Ho! Peace be in this place!

 Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio?

 Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

 For that which, if myself might be his judge,
He should receive his punishment in thanks:
He hath got his friend with child.

 It is true.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted,
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
As with a saint.

 Do not believe it.  Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
Your brother and his lover have embraced:
As those that feed grow full as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

 Is she your cousin?

 She it is.

 This is the point.
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
By those that know the very nerves of state,
His givings-out were of an infinite distance
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
And with full line of his authority,
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind, study and fast.
He--to give fear to use and liberty,
Which have for long run by the hideous law,
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows close the rigour of the statute,
To make him an example. All hope is gone,
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.

 Has censured him
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
A warrant for his execution.

 Assay the power you have.

 Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them.

 But speedily.

 I take my leave of you.

 Give't not o'er so: to him again, entreat him;
Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:
To him, I say!

 You are too cold.

 Ay, touch him; there's the vein.

 Ay, well said.

 That's well said.

 O, to him, to him, wench! he will relent;
He's coming; I perceive't.

 Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o' that.

 Art avised o' that? more on't.

 You had marr'd all else.

 Go to; 'tis well; away!

                           Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

       That's I, an't like your grace;
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.

 No, my good lord;
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

 I warrant your honour.

 Right.

 My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord,
For certain words he spake against your grace
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.

 But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
A very scurvy fellow.

 My lord, most villanously; believe it.

  Well, my lord.

   Carnally, she says.

 Enough, my lord.

  As any in Vienna, on my word.

      This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

      This may prove worse than hanging.

   "
83,lr-11,LEAR,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-11,"  Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.

 Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age;
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
We have this hour a constant will to publish
Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
Since now we will divest us, both of rule,
Interest of territory, cares of state,--
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
That our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
Our eldest-born, speak first.


 Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
With shadowy forest and with champains rich'd,
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
Be this perpetual.   What says our second daughter,
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.

 To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
Although the last, not least; to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

   How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
Lest it may mar your fortunes.

 But goes thy heart with this?

  So young, and so untender?

 Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
Propinquity and property of blood,
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
As thou my sometime daughter.

 Peace, Kent.
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
So be my grave my peace, as here I give
Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
I do invest you jointly with my power,
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
With reservation of an hundred knights,
By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
The name, and all the additions to a king;
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
This coronet part betwixt you.
                               [Giving the crown.
  The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.

 Kent, on thy life, no more.

 Out of my sight!

 Now, by Apollo,--

 O, vassal! miscreant!
                [Laying his hand on his sword.
 Hear me, recreant!
On thine allegiance, hear me!
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
To come between our sentence and our power,
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
Our potency made good, take thy reward.
Five days we do allot thee, for provision
To shield thee from diseases of the world;
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
This shall not be revoked.

 My lord of Burgundy,
We first address towards you, who with this king
Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
Will you require in present dower with her,
Or cease your quest of love?

 Right noble Burgundy,
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
If aught within that little seeming substance,
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
She's there, and she is yours.

 Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
Take her, or leave her?

 Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great king,
I would not from your love make such a stray,
To match you where I hate! therefore beseech you
To avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
Almost to acknowledge hers.

 Better thou
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.

  Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.

 Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
Without our grace, our love, our benison.
Come, noble Burgundy.
            [Flourish.Exeunt all but France,
                 Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia.
                                   Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:
Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
Either his notion weakens, his discernings
Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
Who is it that can tell me who I am?

   Darkness and devils!
Saddle my horses; call my train together.
Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee:
Yet have I left a daughter.

 Woe, that too late repents,--[To
Alb.] O, sir, are you come?
Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
Than the sea-monster!

 Detested kite! thou liest.
My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
That all particulars of duty know,
And in the most exact regard support
The worships of their name. O most small fault,
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love,
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,
                              [Striking his head.
And thy dear judgement out!   Go, go, my people.

 It may be so, my lord.
Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!
Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
To make this creature fruitful!
Into her womb convey sterility!
Dry up in her the organs of increase;
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her!  If she must teem,
Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
To have a thankless child! Away, away!
                                            [Exit.
 What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
Within a fortnight!

 I'll tell thee: [To Gon.] Life and death!  I am ashamed
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
The untented woundings of a father's curse
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?
Let it be so: yet have I left a daughter,
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
When she shall hear this of thee, with her
nails
She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever: thou shalt, I warrant thee.
        [Exeunt Lear, Kent, and Attendants.
             O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
Enter Gentleman.
  'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
And not send back my messenger.

 Ha!
Makest thou this shame thy pastime?

 What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here?

     They durst not do't;
They could not, would not do't; 'tis worse than murder,
To do upon respect such violent outrage:
Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
Thou might'st deserve, or they impose, this usage,
Coming from us.

 O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
Thy element's below!   Where is this daughter?

 Follow me not;
Stay here.

 Deny to speak with me?   They are sick? they are weary?
They have travell'd all the night?   Mere fetches;
The images of revolt and flying off.
Fetch me a better answer.

 Vengeance!   plague! death! confusion!
Fiery?   what quality?   Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
I'll speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

  The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
Are they inform'd of this?   My breath and blood!
Fiery? the fiery duke?   Tell the hot duke that--
No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
To take the indisposed and sickly fit
For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore               [Looking on Kent.
Should he sit here?   This act persuades me
That this remotion of the duke and her
Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death.

  O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!

 Good morrow to you both.

 Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
Sepulchring an adultress.   [To Kent] O, are you free?
Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:
                           [Points to his heart.
I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
With how depraved a quality--O Regan!

 Say, how is that?

 My curses on her!

 Ask her forgiveness?
Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;
                                       [Kneeling.
Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'

 [Rising] Never, Regan:
She hath abated me of half my train;
Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top!   Strike her young bones,
You taking airs, with lameness!

 You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes!   Infect her beauty,
You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
To fall and blast her pride!

 No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
Thy tender-defted nature shall not give
Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in: thou better know'st
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot
Wherein I thee endow'd.

 Who put my man i' the stocks?
                                 [Tucket within.

 This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
Out, varlet, from my sight!

 Who stock'd my servant?   Regan, I have good hope
Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,
Enter GONERIL.
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!
 [To Gon.] Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?

 O sides, you are too tough;
Will you yet hold?   How came my man i' the stocks?

 You! did you?

 Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
To wage against the enmity o' the air;
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
Necessity's sharp pinch!   Return with her?
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom. [Pointing at Oswald.
 I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
I and my hundred knights.

 Is this well spoken?

 I gave you all--

 Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
But kept a reservation to be follow'd
With such a number. What, must I come to you
With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?

 Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
When others are more wicked; not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise.   [To Gon.] I'll go with thee:
Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
And thou art twice her love.

 O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
Are in the poorest things superfluous:
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
If only to go warm were gorgeous,
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
Against their father, fool me not so much
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
Stain my man's cheeks!   No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges on you both,
That all the world shall--I will do such things--
What they are, yet I know not; but they shall be
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;
No, I'll not weep:
I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
    [Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool.
Storm and tempest.
 Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
Singe my white head!   And thou, all-shaking thunder,
Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
Crack nature's moulds, all germens spill at once,
That make ingrateful man!

 Rumble thy bellyful!   Spit, fire! spout, rain!
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
I tax not you, you elements with unkindness;
I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
You owe me no subscription: then let fall
Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,
A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:
But yet I call you servile ministers,
That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!

 No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
I will say nothing.
Enter KENT.
 Let the great gods,
That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue
That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
That under covert and convenient seeming
Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
Rive your concealing continents, and cry
These dreadful summoners grace.   I am a man
More sinn'd against than sinning.

 My wits begin to turn.
Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
I am cold myself.   Where is this straw, my fellow?
The art of our necessities is strange,
That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.
Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
That's sorry yet for thee.

  Let me alone.

 Wilt break my heart?

 Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
But where the greater malady is fix'd,
The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the mind's free,
The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food to 't? But I will punish home:
No, I will weep no more. In such a night
To shut me out!   Pour on; I will endure.
Tn such a night as this!   O Regan, Goneril!
Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave
all,--
O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
No more of that.

 Prithee, go in thyself; seek thine own ease:
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
 [To the Fool] In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--
Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
                                   [Fool goes in.
Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
And show the heavens more just.

 Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
And art thou come to this?

 What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?

 Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy
daughters!

 Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
Those pelican daughters.

    First let me talk with this philosopher.
What is the cause of thunder?

 I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
What is your study?

  O, cry you mercy, sir.
Noble philosopher, your company.

 Come, let's in all.

 With him;
I will keep still with my philosopher.

   To have a thousand with red burning spits
Come hissing in upon 'em,--

 It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
[To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;
 [To the Fool] Thou, sapient sir, sit here.
Now, you she foxes!

 I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
 [To Edgar] Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;
[To the Fool] And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
Bench by his side: [To Kent] you are o' the commission,
Sit you too.

   And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
What store her heart is made on.   Stop her there!
Arms, arms, sword, fire!   Corruption in the place!
False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?

 The little dogs and all,
Tray, Blanch, and Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.

   No, they cannot touch me for coining;
I am the king himself.

    Ay, every inch a king:
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
Adultery?
Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly
Does lecher in my sight.
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
Behold yond simpering dame,
Whose face between her forks presages snow;
That minces virtue, and does shake the head
To hear of pleasure's name;
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
With a more riotous appetite.
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
Though women all above:
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
Beneath is all the fiends';
There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit,
      Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
And, like a scurvy politician, seem
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.

 If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
Thou know'st the first time that we smell the air,
We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.

 When we are born, we cry that we are come
To this great stage of fools: this' a good block;
It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
A troop of horse with felt: I'll put't in proof;
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants.
 No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
I am cut to the brains.

 No seconds? all myself?
Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
Ay, and laying autumn's dust.

 I will die bravely, like a bridegroom.
What!
I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,
My masters, know you that.

  You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
Do scald like molten lead.

  You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?

 Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
To see another thus. I know not what to say.
I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
Of my condition!

 Pray, do not mock me:
I am a very foolish fond old man,
Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
And, to deal plainly,
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant
What place this is; and all the skill I have
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
For, as I am a man, I think this lady
To be my child Cordelia.

 Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith.   I pray, weep not:
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
I know you do not love me; for your sisters
Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
You have some cause, they have not.

 Am I in France?

  Do not abuse me.

 You must bear with me:
Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
        [Exeunt all but Kent and Gentleman.
 No, no, no, no!   Come, let's away to prison:
We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
And take upon's the mystery of things,
As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
That ebb and flow by the moon.

 Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
The gods themselves throw incense.   Have I caught thee?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve first.
Come. [Exeunt Lear and Cordelia, guarded.
 Howl, howl, howl, howl!   O, you are men of stones:
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
She's dead as earth.   Lend me a looking-glass;
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
Why, then she lives.

 This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
That ever I have felt.
 Prithee, away.

 A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
What is't thou say'st?   Her voice was ever soft,
Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.

 Did I not, fellow?
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip: I am old now,
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
Mine eyes are not o' the best:   I'll tell you straight.

  He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.

  I'll see that straight.

 You are welcome hither.

 Ay, so I think.

 And my poor fool is hang'd!   No, no, no life!
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
Never, never, never, never, never!
Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
Do you see this?   Look on her, look, her lips,
Look there, look there!                    [Dies.
"
84,lor.,LORENZO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-lor.," My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.

 Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
For Gratiano never lets me speak.

 Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,
Disguise us at my lodging and return,
All in an hour.

 'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
To furnish us. Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter.
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?

 I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ.

 Whither goest thou?

 Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
I will not fail her; speak it privately.
Go, gentlemen,      [Exit Launcelot.
Will you prepare you for this masque to-night?
I am provided of a torch-bearer.

 Meet me and Gratiano
At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.

 I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
How I shall take her from her father's house,
What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
What page's suit she hath in readiness.
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
Unless she do it under this excuse,
That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.
[Exeunt.
 Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
Here dwells my father Jew.   Ho! who's within?
Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes.
 Lorenzo, and thy love.

 Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.

 Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

 So are you, sweet,
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
But come at once;
For the close night doth play the runaway,
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.

 Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
Enter, JESSICA, below.
What, art thou come?   On, gentlemen; away!
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
[Exit with Jessica and Salarino.
Enter ANTONIO.
 I thank your honor. For my part, my lord,
My purpose was not to have seen you here;
But meeting with Salerio by the way,
He did intreat me, past all saying nay,
To come with him along.

 Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
You have a noble and a true conceit
Of god-like amity; which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But if you knew to whom you show this honor,
How true a gentleman you send relief,
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
I know you would be prouder of the work
Than customary bounty can enforce you.

 Madam, with all my heart;
I shall obey you in all fair commands.

 Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!

       O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
The fool hath planted in his memory
An army of good words; and I do know
A many fools, that stand in better place,
Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
Defy the matter. How cheer'st thou, Jessica?
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?

 Even such a husband
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.

 I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.

 No, pray thee, let it serve for tabletalk;
Then, howsoe'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
I shall digest it.

 The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
And they did make no noise, in such a night
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
Where Cressid lay that night.

 In such a night
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
To come again to Carthage.

 In such a night
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
As far as Belmont.

 In such a night
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.

 Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

 A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?

 Who comes with her?

 He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
And ceremoniously let us prepare
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
Enter LAUNCELOT.
 Who calls?

 Leave hollaing, man: here.

 Here.

 Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
And yet no matter: why should we go in?
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
And bring your music forth into the air.
                            [Exit Stephano.
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
Such harmony is in immortal souls;
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
Enter Musicians.
Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn:
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear
And draw her home with music. [Music.
 The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
Which is the hot condition of their blood;
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
Or any air of music touch their ears,
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
But music for the time doth change his nature.
The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
The motions of his spirit are dull as night
And his affections dark as Erebus:
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA.
 That is the voice,
Or I am much deceived, of Portia.

 Dear lady, welcome home.

 Madam, they are not yet;
But there is come a messenger before,
To signify their coming.

 Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.

 Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
Of starved people.

"
85,cor-21,Messenger,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-21," Where's Caius Marcius?

 The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

 They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.

 Within this mile and half.

 The citizens of Corioli have issued,
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
I saw our party to their trenches driven,
And then I came away.

 Above an hour, my lord.

 Spies of the Volsces
Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
Half an hour since brought my report.

 You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That Marcius shall be consul:
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
The blind to hear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
I never saw the like.

 The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house: some news is come
That turns their countenances.

 Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd.

 It is spoke freely out of many mouths—
How probable I do not know—that Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The young'st and oldest thing.

 You are sent for to the senate:
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Upon our territories; and have already
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
What lay before them.
Enter COMINIUS.
 Sir, if you 'ld save your life, fly to your house:
The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
They'll give him death by inches.
Enter a second Messenger.
 Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

 As certain as I know the sun is fire:
Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together.
The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
Tabors and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
Make the sun dance. Hark you!

A shout within.
 Sir, we have all
Great cause to give great thanks.

 Almost at point to enter.

"
86,tgv-10,DUKE OF MILAN,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tgv.xml-tgv-10," Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
What say you to a letter from your friends
Of much good news?

 Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman ?

 Hath he not a son?

 You know him well?

 Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
He is as worthy for an empress' love
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
With commendation from great potentates;
And here he means to spend his time awhile:
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.

 Welcome him then according to his worth.
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it;
I will send him hither to you presently.  [Exit.
 Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
We have some secrets to confer about.
                                   [Exit Thu.
Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?

 Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
Which to requite, command me while I live.
This love of theirs myself have often seen,
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Sir Valentine her company and my court:
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
And so unworthily disgrace the man,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
And, that thou mayest perceive my fear of this,
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
The key whereof myself have ever kept;
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.

 Upon mine honour, he shall never know
That I had any light from thee of this.

 Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?

 Be they of much import?

 Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
I am to break with thee of some affairs
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.

 No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
Neither regarding that she is my child
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
I now am full resolved to take a wife
And turn her out to who will take her in:
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
For me and my possessions she esteems not.

 There is a lady in Verona here
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
For long agone I have forgot to court;
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
How and which way I may bestow myself
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.

 But she did scorn a present that I sent her.

 But she I mean is promised by her friends
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
And kept severely from resort of men,
That no man hath access by day to her.

 Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
That no man hath recourse to her by night.

 Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Without apparent hazard of his life.

 Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.

 This very night; for Love is like a child,
That longs for everything that he can come by.

 But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?

 A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?

 Then let me see thy cloak:
I'll get me one of such another length.

 How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
What letter is this same?   What's here? 'To Silvia'!
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
         [Reads.
'My thoughts do harbor with my Silvia nightly.
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
O, could their master come and go as lightly,
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them;
While I, their king, that hither them importune,
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
What's here?
'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
Why, Phaethon,--for thou art Merops' son,--
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
Is privilege for thy departure hence:
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
  [Exit.
 Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.

 This weak impress of love is as a figure
Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
Enter PROTEUS.
How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
According to our proclamation gone?

 My daughter takes his going grievously.

 So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
Makes me the better to confer with thee.

 Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.

 And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
How she opposes her against my will.

 Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
What might we do to make the girl forget
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?

 Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.

 Then you must undertake to slander him.

 Where your good word cannot advantage him,
Your slander cannot endamage him;
Therefore the office is indifferent,
Being entreated to it by your friend.

 And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
Because we know, on Valentine's report,
You are already Love's firm votary
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
Upon this warrant shall you have access
Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
Where you may temper her by your persuasion
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.

 Ay,
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.

 This discipline shows thou hast been in love.

 About it, gentlemen!

 Even now about it! I will pardon you.     [Exeunt.
 How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?

 Saw you my daughter?

 Why then,
She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
And Eglamour is in her company.
'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
Besides, she did intend confession
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
But mount you presently and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled:
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
                                             [Exit.
 Sir Valentine!

 The more degenerate and base art thou,
To make such means for her as thou hast done
And leave her on such slight conditions.
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
Plead a new state in thy unrival'd merit,
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.

 I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.

 Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee;
Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
Come, let us go: we will include all jars
With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.

 I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.

 What mean you by that saying?

"
87,orl.,ORLANDO,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-orl.,"   Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
   O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
      I attend them with all respect and duty.

     Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.

  I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
To be adopted heir to Frederick.

 Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.

 What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.

O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Re-enter LE BEAU.
 I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this;
Which of the two was daughter of the duke
That here was at the wrestling?

 I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
[Exit Le Beau. 
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
But heavenly Rosalind!
                                 [Exit. Who's there?

 Why, what's the matter?

 Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?

 What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
A thievish living on the common road?
This I must do, or know not what to do:
Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
I rather will subject me to the malice
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.

 O good old man, how well in thee appears
The constant service of the antique world,
When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
Where none will sweat but for promotion,
And having that, do choke their service up
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
But come thy ways; we'll go along together,
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
We'll light upon some settled low content.

  Forbear, and eat no more.

 Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.

 You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
He dies that touches any of this fruit
Till I and my affairs are answered.

 I almost die for food; and let me have it.

 Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
I thought that all things had been savage here;
And therefore put I on the countenance
Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
That in this desert inaccessible,
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
If ever you have look'd on better days,
If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
If ever sat at any good man's feast,
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.

 Then but forbear your food a little while,
Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
And give it food. There is an old poor man,
Who after me hath many a weary step
Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
I will not touch a bit.

 I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
                            [Exit. 
 I thank you most for him.

 Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;
That every eye which in this forest looks
Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree
The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.
[Exit. 
Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE. 
  I do desire we may be better strangers.

  Yes, just.

  Just as high as my heart.

     Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.

  Very well: what would you?

   I prithee, who doth he trot withal?

 Who ambles Time withal?

 Who doth he gallop withal?

 Who stays it still withal?

 Where dwell you, pretty youth?

 Are you native of this place?

   I prithee, recount some of them.

  What were his marks?

   Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.

 Did you ever cure any so?

 I would not be cured, youth.

  With all my heart, good youth.

 Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!

  Pardon me, dear Rosalind.

 Of a snail?

 What's that?

  I would kiss before I spoke.

 How if the kiss be denied?

  What, of my suit?

  Then in mine own person I die.

  Then love me, Rosalind.

 And wilt thou have me?

 What sayest thou?

 I hope so.

 Pray thee, marry us.

 I will.

 Why now; as fast as she can marry us.

 I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

 So do all thoughts; they are winged.

 For ever and a day.

 But will my Rosalind do so?

 O, but she is wise.

     Ay, sweet Rosalind.

    It is my arm.

 Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.

 Ay, and greater wonders than that.

  I can live no longer by thinking.

 Speakest thou in sober meanings?

 And I for Rosalind.

 And I for Rosalind.

 And so am I for Rosalind.

   Nor I.       [Exeunt. I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;
As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE. 
 That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.

 My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
Whom he reports to be a great magician,

Obscured in the circle of this forest.
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY.
 If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.

88,cran.,CRANMER,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h8.xml-cran.," I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.

 It is my duty
To attend your highness' pleasure.

 I humbly thank your highness;
And am right glad to catch this good occasion
Most thoroughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff
And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,
There's none stands under more calumnious tongues
Than I myself, poor man.

 Most dread liege,
The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:
If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,
Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,
Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing
What can be said against me.

 God and your majesty
Protect mine innocence, or I fall into
The trap is laid for me!

 I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,
That was sent to me from the council, pray'd me
To make great haste. All fast? what means this?   Ho!
Who waits there?   Sure, you know me?
Enter Keeper.
 Why?
Enter DOCTOR BUTTS.
 So.

 'Tis Butts,
The king's physician: as he pass'd along,
How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!
Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace! For certain,
This is of purpose laid by some that hate me--
God turn their hearts!   I never sought their malice--
To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me
Wait else at door, a fellow-counsellor,
'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys.   But their pleasures
Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.
Enter the KING and BUTTS at a window
above.
 My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress
Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,
And with no little study, that my teaching
And the strong course of my authority
Might go one way, and safely; and the end
Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,
I speak it with a single heart, my lords,
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
Both in his private conscience and his place,
Defacers of a public peace, than I do.
Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart
With less allegiance in it! Men that make
Envy and crooked malice nourishment
Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,
That, in this case of justice, my accusers,
Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
And freely urge against me.

 Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;
You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,
You are so merciful: I see your end;
'Tis my undoing; love and meekness, lord,
Become a churchman better than ambition:
Win straying souls with modesty again,
Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,
I make as little doubt, as you do conscience
In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
But reverence   to your calling makes me modest.

 Is there no other way of mercy,
But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?

 For me?
Must I go like a traitor thither?

 Stay, good my lords,
I have a little yet to say.   Look there, my lords;
By virtue of that ring, I take my cause
Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it
To a most noble judge, the king my master.

 The greatest monarch now alive may glory
In such an honour: how may I deserve it,
That am a poor and humble subject to you?

 And let heaven
Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.

 And to your royal grace, and the good queen,
My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:
All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,
Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,
May hourly fall upon ye!

 Elizabeth.

 Amen.

 Let me speak, sir,
For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.
This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--
Though in her cradle, yet now promises
Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be
But few now living can behold that goodness--
A pattern to all princes living with her,
And all that shall succeed: Saba was never
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,
With all the virtues that attend the good,
Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:
She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:
In her days every man shall eat in safety,
Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
The merry songs of peace to all his nighbours:
God shall be truly known; and those about her
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,
And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Her ashes new create another heir,
As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
That were the servants to this chosen infant,
Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
His honour and the greatness of his name
Shall be, and make new   nations: he shall flourish,
And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches
To all the plains about him: our children's children
Shall see this, and bless heaven.

 She shall be, to the happiness of England,
An aged princess; many days shall see her,
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
Would I had known no more! but she must die,
She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
A most unspotted fly shall she pass
To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.

His child, I wis, to incest bring;

Losing a mite, a mountain gain.

CLEON; all the train with them. Enter at
another door a Gentleman, with a letter to 
PERICLES; PERICLES shows the letter to
CLEON; gives the Messenger a reward, and
knights him.Exit PERICLES at one door, 
and CLEON at another.
Good Helicane, that stay'd at home.
Not to eat honey like a drone
From others' labors; for though he strive
To killen bad, keep good alive;          
And to fulfil his prince' desire,
Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:
How Thaliard came full bent with sin
And had intent to murder him;
And that in Tarsus was not best
Longer for him to make his rest.
He, doing so, put forth to seas,
Where when men been, there's seldom ease;
For now the wind begins to blow;
Thunder above and deeps below         
Make such unquiet, that the ship
Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;
And he, good prince, having all lost,
By waves from coast to coast is tost:
All perishen of man, of pelf,
Ne aught escapen but himself;
Till fortune, tired with doing bad,
Threw him ashore, to give him glad:
And here he comes. What shall be next,
Pardon old Gower,--this longs the text. 
[Exit. Now sleep yslaked hath the rout;
No din but snores the house about,
Made louder by the o'er-fed breast
Of this most pompous marriage-feast.
The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
Now couches fore the mouse's hole;
And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,
E'er the blither for their drouth.
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,
Where, by the loss of maidenhead,       
A babe is moulded.   Be attent,
And time that is so briefly spent
With your fine fancies quaintly eche:
What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.

Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES, at one door,
with Attendants; a Messenger meets them,
kneels, and gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES 
shows it SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel
to him.   Then enter THAISA with child, with
LYCHORIDA a nurse.   The KING shows her
the letter; she rejoices:  she and PERICLES
takes leave of her father, and depart with 
LYCHORIDA and their Attendants.
Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest.]
By many a dern and painful perch
Of Pericles the careful search,
By the four opposing coigns
Which the world together joins,
Is made with all due diligence
That horse and sail and high expense     
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
Fame answering the most strange inquire,
To the court of King Simonides
Are letters brought, the tenor these:
Antiochus and his daughter dead;
The men of Tyrus on the head
Of Helicanus would set on
The crown of Tyre, but he will none:
The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
Says to 'em, if King Pericles             
Come not home in twice six moons,
He, obedient to their dooms,
Will take the crown. The sum of this,
Brought hither to Pentapolis,
Y-ravished the regions round,
And every one with claps can sound,
'Our heir-apparent is a king!
Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
His queen with child makes her desire--
Which who shall cross?--along to go:
Omit we all their dole and woe:
Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
On Neptune's billow; half the flood
Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood
Varies again; the grisled north
Disgorges such a tempest forth,
That, as a duck for life that dives,
So up and down the poor ship drives:   
The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
Does fall in travail with her fear:
And what ensues in this fell storm
Shall for itself itself perform.
I nill relate, action may
Conveniently the rest convey;
Which might not what by me is told.
In your imagination hold
This stage the ship, upon whose deck     
The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.
[Exit. Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
Welcomed and settled to his own desire.
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
Unto Diana there a votaress.
Now to Marina bend your mind,
Whom our fast-growing scene must find
At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd
In music, letters; who hath gain'd
Of education all the grace,
Which makes her both the heart and place
Of general wonder. But, alack,
That monster envy, oft the wrack
Of earned praise, Marina's life
Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
And in this kind hath our Cleon
One daughter, and a wench full grown,
Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
Hight Philoten: and it is said
For certain in our story, she
Would ever with Marina be:             
Be't when she weaved the sleided silk
With fingers long, small, white as milk;
Or when she would with sharp needle wound
The cambric, which she made more sound
By hurting it; or when to the lute
She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
That still records with moan; or when
She would with rich and constant pen
Vail to her mistress Dian; still
This Philoten contends in skill            
With absolute Marina: so
With the dove of Paphos might the crow
Vie feathers white. Marina gets
All praises, which are paid as debts,
And not as given. This so darks
In Philoten all graceful marks,
That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
A present murderer does prepare
For good Marina, that her daughter
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.   
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
And cursed Dionyza hath
The pregnant instrument of wrath
Prest for this blow. The unborn event
I do commend to your content:
Only I carry winged time
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;
Which never could I so convey,
Unless your thoughts went on my way. 
Dionyza does appear,
With Leonine, a murderer.
Exit. Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for 't;
Making, to take your imagination,
From bourn to bourn, region to region.
By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
To use one language in each several clime
Where our scenes seem to live.   I do beseech you
To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
The stages of our story. Pericles
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
Attended on by many a lord and knight,
To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
Advanced in time to great and high estate,
Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,
Old Helicanus goes along behind.
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile; 
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.DUMB SHOW.
Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his
   train; CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other.
 CLEON shows PERICLES the tomb; whereat
   PERICLES makes lamentation, puts on sack-cloth, and in a mighty passion departs. 
   Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA.
See how belief may suffer by foul show!
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks.   He swears
Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears, 
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit
The epitaph is for Marina writ
By wicked Dionyza.
[Reads the inscription on Marina's                      monument.
'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
Who wither'd in her spring of year.
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,
Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd: 
Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'
No visor does become black villany
So well as soft and tender flattery.
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
And bear his courses to be ordered
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
In her unholy service. Patience, then, 
And think you now are all in Mytilene.
[Exit. Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
Into an honest house, our story says.
She sings like one immortal, and she dances
As goddess-like to her admired lays;
Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes
Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
That even her art sisters the natural roses;
Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,   
Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
She gives the cursed bawd.   Here we her place;
And to her father turn our thoughts again,
Where we left him, on the sea.   We there him lost;
Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
And to him in his barge with fervor hies. 
In your supposing once more put your sight
Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
Where what is done in action, more, if might,
Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
Exit. Now our sands are almost run;
More a little, and then dumb.
This, my last boon, give me,
For such kindness must relieve me,
That you aptly will suppose
What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
The regent made in Mytilene
To greet the king. So he thrived,
That he is promised to be wived         
To fair Marina; but in no wise
Till he had done his sacrifice,
As Dian bade: whereto being bound,
The interim, pray you, all confound.
In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,
And wishes fall out as they're will'd.
At Ephesus, the temple see,
Our king and all his company.
That he can hither come so soon,
Is by your fancy's thankful doom.  
Exit.  In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last: 
In Helicanus may you well descry
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
In reverend Cerimon there well appears
The worth that learned charity aye wears:
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
Had spread their cursed deed, and honor'd name
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
That him and his they in his palace burn;
The gods for murder seemed so content
To punish them; although not done, but meant. 
So, on your patience evermore attending,
New joy wait on you!   Here our play has ending.
[Exit. "
90,flo.,FLORIZEL,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wt.xml-flo.," These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
And you the queen on't.

 I bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight across
Thy father's ground.

 Apprehend
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
Humbling their deities to love, have taken
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull, and   bellow'd; the green Neptune
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
As I seem now. Their transformations
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
Run not before mine honor, nor my lusts
Burn hotter than my faith.

 Thou dearest Perdita,
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
Or not my father's. For I cannot be
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
Of celebration of that nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come.

 See, your guests approach:
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
And let's be red with mirth.
Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised.
 What, like a corse?

 What you do
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet,
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
Nothing but that; move still, still so,
And own no other function: each your doing,
So singular in each particular,
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
That all your acts are queens.

 I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
That never mean to part.

 Old sir, I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are:
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
Up in my heart; which I have given already,
But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
Before this ancient sir, who it should seem,
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove's down and as white as it
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd snow that's bolted
By the northern blasts twice o'er.

 Do, and be witness to't.

 And he, and more
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
That, were crown'd the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
Without her love; for her employ them all;
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition.

 O, that must be
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us 'fore those witnesses.

 I have: but what of him?

 He neither does nor shall.

 No, good sir;
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age.

 I yield all this;
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
My father of this business.

 He shall not.

 No, he must not.

 Come, come, he must not.
Mark our contract.

 Why look you so upon me?
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
More straining on for plucking back, not following
My leash unwillingly.

 I not purpose it.
I think, Camillo?

 It cannot fail but by
The violation of my faith; and then
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
From my succession wipe me, father; I
Am heir to my affection.

 I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
Do bid it welcome.

 So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
As you have ever been my father's honor'd friend,
When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
Upon his passion: let myself and fortune
Tug for the time to come. This you may know
And so deliver, I am put to sea
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
For this design. What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
Concern me the reporting.

 Hark, Perdita. [Drawing her aside.]
I'll hear you by and by.

 Now, good Camillo;
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony.

 Very nobly
Have you deserved: it is my father's music
To speak your deeds, not little of his care
To have them recompensed as thought on.

 How, Camillo,
May this, almost a miracle, be done?
That I may call thee something more than man
And after that trust to thee.

 Not any yet:
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do, so we profess
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows.

 Worthy Camillo,
What color for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him?

 I am bound to you:
There is some sap in this.

 My good Camillo,
She is as forward of her breeding as
She is i' the rear our birth.

 My prettiest Perdita!
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
Preserver of my father, now of me,
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's sop,
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

 And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--

  Should I now meet my father,
He would not call me son.

 O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
Pray you, a word.

 Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

 By his command
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
His wish'd ability, he had himself
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
And those that bear them living.

 Good my lord,
She came from Libya.

 Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
To execute the charge my father gave me
For visiting your highness: my best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
Not only my success in Libya, sir,
But my arrival and my wife's in safety
Here where we are.

 Camillo has betray'd me;
Whose honor and whose honesty till now
Endured all weathers.

 We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
The odds for high and low's alike.

 She is,
When once she is my wife.

 Dear, look up:
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
Should chase us with my father, power no jot
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
Remember since you owed no more to time
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
Step forth mine advocate; at your request
My father will grant precious things as trifles.

"
91,pand.,CARDINAL PANDULPH,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-pand.," Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
Do in his name religiously demand
Why thou against the church, our holy mother,
So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop
Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
This, in our aforesaid holy father's name,
Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.

 Then, by the lawful power that I have,
Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate:
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
From his allegiance to an heretic;
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
Canonized and worshipp'd as a saint,
That takes away by any secret course
Thy hateful life.

 There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.

 Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;
And raise the power of France upon his head,
Unless he do submit himself to Rome.

 What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?

 All form is formless, order orderless,
Save what is opposite to England's love.
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.

 So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,
That is, to be the champion of our church!
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
And may not be performed by thyself,
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Is not amiss when it is truly done,
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
The truth is then most done not doing it:
The better act of purposes mistook
Is to mistake again; though indirect,
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
It is a religion that doth make vows kept;
But thou hast sworn against religion,
But what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions:
Upon which better part our prayers come in,
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
The peril of our course light on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
But in despair die under their black weight.

 I will denounce a curse upon his head.

 Courage and comfort all shall yet go well.

 Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.

 You hold too heinous a respect of grief.

 Before the curing of a strong disease,
Even in the instant of repair and health,
The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,
On their departure most of all show evil:
What have you lost by losing of this day?

 If you had won it, certainly you had.
No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
She looks upon them with a threatening eye.
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
In this which he accounts so clearly won:
Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?

 Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
For even the breath of what I mean to speak
Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
Out of the path which shall directly lead
Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be
That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
The misplaced John should entertain an hour
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;
And he that stands upon a slippery place
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;
So be it, for it cannot be but so.

 You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.

 How green you are and fresh in this old world!
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
That none so small advantage shall step forth
To check his reign, but they will cherish it;
No natural exhalation in the sky,
No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,
No common wind, no customed event,
But they will pluck away his natural cause
And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,
Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.

 O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
If that young Arthur be not gone already,
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
Of all his people shall revolt from him
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
And, O, what better matter breeds for you
Than I have named!  The bastard Faulconbridge
Is now in England, ransacking the church,
Offending charity: if but a dozen French
Were there in arms, they would be as a call
To train ten thousand English to their s'de,
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful
What may be wrought out of their discontent,
Now that their souls are topfull of offence.
For England go: I will whet on the king.

 Take again
>From this my hand, as holding of the pope

Your sovereign greatness and authority.

 It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
But since you are a gentle convertite,
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
And make fair weather in your blustering land.
On this Ascension-day, remember well,
Upon your oath of service to the pope,
Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
                           [Exit.
 Hail, noble prince of France!
The next is this, King John hath reconciled
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,
That so stood out against the holy church,
The great metropolis and see of Rome:
Therefore thy threatening colors now wind up;
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
That, like a lion foster'd up at hand,
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
And be no further harmful than in show.

 You look but on the outside of this work.

 The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
And will not temporize with my entreaties;
He flatly says he 'll not lay down his arms.

 Give me leave to speak.

"
92,shy.,SHYLOCK,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-shy.,"         How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him for he is a Christian,
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
If I forgive him!

 I am debating of my present store,
And, by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
Do you desire?  [To Ant.] Rest you fair, good signior;
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.

 Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

 I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.

 When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
The third possessor; ay, he was the third--

 No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
And, when the work of generation was
Between these woolly breeders in the act,
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
Fall parti-color'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.

 I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
But note me, signior.

 Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--

 Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit.
What should I say to you? Should I not say
'Hath a dog money? is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
With bated breath and whispering humbleness,
Say this;
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
You spurn'd me such a day; another time
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?

 Why, look you, how you storm!
I would be friends with you and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
Supply your present wants and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
This is kind I offer.

 This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.

 O father Abram, what these Christians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
If he should break his day, what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.   I say,
To buy his favor, I extend this friendship:
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

 Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond,
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
See to my house, left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
I will be with you.

 Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
As thou hast done with me: What, Jessica!--
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
Why, Jessica, I say!

 Who bids thee call?   I do not bid thee call.

 I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
For I did dream of money-bags to-night.

 So do I his.

 What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
Clamber not you up to the casements then,
Nor thrust your head into the public street
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
Say I will come.

 What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?

 The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
More than the wild-cat; drones hive not with me;
Therefore I part with him, and part with him
To one that I would have him help to waste
His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
Perhaps I will return immediately:
Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
Fast bind, fast find;
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind. [Exit.
  She is damned for it.

 My own flesh and blood to rebel!

 I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.

     What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?

       Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
Gaoler, look to him.

 I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
To come abroad with him at his request.

 I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
To Christian inercessors. Follow not;
I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
[Exit.
 I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
But, say, it is my humor: is it answer'd?
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it baned?   What, are you answer'd yet?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend, himself being offended;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

 I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

 Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

 What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

 If every ducat in six thousand ducats
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.

 What judgement shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
Be season'd with such viands?   You will answer
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for judgement: answer; shall I have it?

 To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

 No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

 Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
To cureless ruin.   I stand here for law.

 Shylock is my name.

 On what compulsion must I? tell me that.

 My deeds upon my head!   I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

 A Daniel come to judgement! yea, a Daniel!
O wise young judge, how I do honor thee!

 Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

 An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not, for Venice.

 When it is paid according to the tenor.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgement: by my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.

 O noble judge!   O excellent young man!

 'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

 Ay, his breast:
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.

 I have them ready.

 Is it so nominated in the bond?

 I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.

 These be the Christian husbands.   I have a daughter;
Would any of the stock of Barrabas
Had been her husband rather than a Christian! [Aside.
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.

 Most rightful judge!

 Most learned judge!   A sentence! Come, prepare!

 Is that the law?

 I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
And let the Christian go.

 Give me my principal, and let me go.

 Shall I not have barely my principal?

 Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.

 Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live.

 I am content.

 I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
I am not well: send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.

93,lr-13,EDGAR,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lr.xml-lr-13,"          I am sure on't, not a word.

 I heard myself proclaim'd;
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
I will preserve myself: and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury, in contempt of man,
Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
Blanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots;
And with presented nakedness out-face
The winds and persecutions of the sky.
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
And with this horrible object, from low farms,
Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.

   And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!

Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.

     Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.

 When we our betters see bearing our woes,
We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er-skip,
When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
How light and portable my pain seems now,
When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.

Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,

The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,

The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
Enter GLOUCESTER, led by Old Man.

So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'

  You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.

 Horrible steep.
Hark, do you hear the sea?

 Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes' anguish.

 You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
But in my garments.

 Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong.

 Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright.

 Now fare you well, good sir.

 Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it.

 Gone, sir: farewell.
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life, when life itself
Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
Ho, you sir! friend!   Hear you, sir! speak!
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
What are you, sir?

 Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
So many fathom down precipitating,
Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.

 From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.

 Give me your arm:
Up: so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.

 This is above all strangeness.
Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
Which parted from you?

 As I stood here below, methought his eyes
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honors
Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.

    I would not take this from report; it is,
And my heart breaks at it.

 O, matter and impertinency mix'd!
Reason in madness!

 Hail, gentle sir.

  Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?

 But, by your favour,
How near's the other army?

 I thank you, sir: that's all.

 I thank you, sir.
                                     [Exit Gent.
 Well pray you, father.

 A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
Am pregnant to good pity.   Give me your hand,
I'll lead you to some biding.

 Chill not let go, zir, without vurther
'casion.

   I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
As badness would desire.

  Sit you down, father; rest you
Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
Their papers, is more lawful.
   [Reads]O undistinguished space of woman's will!
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
And the exchange my brother!   Here, in the sands,
Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
With this ungracious paper strike the sight
Of the death-practised duke: for him 'tis well
That of thy death and business I can tell.

 Give me your hand:
                                 [Drum afar off.
Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.
                                         [Exeunt.
 If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
Hear me one word.

 Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
I can produce a champion that will prove
What is vouched there. If you miscarry,
Your business of the world hath so an end,
And machination ceases. Fortune love you!

 I was forbid it.
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
And I'll appear again.

 Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
If I ever I return to you again,
I'll bring you comfort.

 Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
Give me thy hand; come on.

 What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
Their going hence, even as their coming hither:
Ripeness is all: come on.

 Know, my name is lost;
By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope.

  What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?

 Draw thy sword,
That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
My oath, and my profession: I protest,
Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
And, from the extremest upward of thy head
To the descent and dust below thy foot,
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
Thou liest.

 Let's exchange charity.
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to plague us:
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes.

 Worthy prince, I know't.

 By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
The bloody proclamation to escape,
That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
That we the pain of death would hourly die
Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
Burst smilingly.

 This would have seem'd a period
To such as love not sorrow; but another,
To amplify too much, would make much more,
And top extremity.
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
He fasten'd on my neck, and bellow'd out
As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear received: which in recounting
His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
And there I left him tranced.

 Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
Improper for a slave.
Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife.
 What kind of help?

 What means that bloody knife?

 Here comes Kent.

 To who, my lord?   Who hath the office? send
Thy token of reprieve.

 Or image of that horror?

 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

 Very bootless.
Enter a Captain.
 He faints!   My lord, my lord!

 Look up, my lord.

 He is gone, indeed.

"
94,ant.,ANTONIO,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tmp.xml-ant.,"   We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!


 Let's all sink with the king.

                    And most chirurgeonly.

 Very foul.

 He'ld sow 't with nettle-seed.

  None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

 Long live Gonzalo!

     We two, my lord,
Will guard your person while you take your rest,
And watch your safety.

 It is the quality o' the climate.

 Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all, as by consent;
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
Worthy   Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.

 Do you not hear me speak?

 Noble Sebastian,
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
Whiles thou art waking.

 I am more serious than my custom: you
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
Trebles thee o'er.

 I'll teach you how to flow.

 O,
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth.

 Thus, sir:
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
Who shall be of as little memory
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded,--
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
As he that sleeps here swims.

 O, out of that 'no hope'
What great hope have you! no hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
That Ferdinand is drown'd?

 Then, tell me,
Who's the next heir of Naples?

 She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
The man i' the moon's too slow--till newborn chins
Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
And by that destiny to perform an act
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
In yours and my discharge.

 A space whose every cubit
Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
Measure us back to Naples?   Keep in Tunis,
And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
For your advancement   Do you understand me?

 And how does your content
Tender your own good fortune?

 True:
And look how well my garments sit upon me;
Much feater than before: my brother's servants
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.

 Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
And melt ere they molest!   Here lies your brother,
No better than the earth he lies upon,
If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
They'll tell the clock to any business that
We say befits the hour.

 Draw together;
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
To fall it on Gonzalo.

 Then let us both be sudden.

 O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions.

 I am right glad that he 's so out of hope.
Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
That you resolved to effect.

 Let it be to-night;
For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
As when they are fresh.


 I'll believe both;
And what does else want credit, come to me,
And I'll be sworn 'tis true; travellers ne'er did lie,
Though fools at home condemn 'em.

 I'll be thy second.

[Exeunt Seb. and Ant.
 Very like; one of them
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.

"
95,biron.,BIRON,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-biron.," I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances;
As, not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day--
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

 Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your grace
And stay here in your court for three years' space.

 By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study? let me know.

 Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

 Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know:
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Study to break it and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

 Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
As, painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others' books.
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.

 The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.

 Fit in his place and time.

 Something then in rhyme.

 Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows.
So you, to study now it is too late,
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.

 No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.

    This article, my liege, yourself must break;
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
A maid of grace and complete majesty--
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
Therefore this article is made in vain,
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.

 So study evermore is overshot:
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should,
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.

 Necessity will make us forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born,
Not by might mastered but by special grace:
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
So to the laws at large I write my name:Subscribes.
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
But is there no quick recreation granted?

 Armado is a most illustrious wight,
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.

          I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.

 Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

  You must not be so quick.

 Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

     Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.

     Now, God save thy life!

 I cannot stay thanksgiving.
Retiring.

      Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.

 Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

   Why, villain, thou must know first.

 The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
And to her white hand see thou do commend
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
Giving him a shilling. 
 And I, forsooth, in love!   I, that
have been love's whip;
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
Sole imperator and great general
Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
And I to be a corporal of his field,
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
A woman, that is like a German clock,
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
And never going aright. being a watch,
But being watch'd that it may still go right!
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
And, among three, to love the worst of all;
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might.
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
[Exit.
   Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
 Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper. 
  One drunkard loves another of the name.

 I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.

 O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
Disfigure not his slop.

 This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.

 All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky,
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'er-eye.
More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
         Enter DUMAIN, with a paper.
Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!

 O most profane coxcomb!

 By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.

 An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.

 Stoop, I say;
Her shoulder is with child.

 Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.

 Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?

 A fever in your blood! why, then incision
Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!

 Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.

 Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.

Advancing.
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears;
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
But I a beam do find in each of three.
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
And, gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? all about the breast:
A caudle, ho!

 Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in;
I am betray'd, by keeping company
With men like men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
In pruning me?   When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb?

 I post from love: good lover, let me go.
 Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD. 
 A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.

 Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were born to do me shame.
Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.

 That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.

 True, true; we are four.
Will these turtles be gone?

 Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.

 Did they, quoth you?   Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
That is not blinded by her majesty?

 My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
Where several worthies make one dignity,
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
Fie, painted rhetoric!   O, she needs it not:
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.

 Is ebony like her?  O wood divine!
A  wife of such wood were felicity.
O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
If that she learn not of her eye to look:
No face is fair that is not full so black.

 Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
For native blood is counted painting now;
And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

 Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.

 I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.

 O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!

 Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.

 'Tis more than need.
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
Consider what you first did swear unto,
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
In that each of you have forsworn his book,
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
Have found the ground of study's excellence
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
[From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;
They are the ground, the books, the academes
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.]
Why, universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries,
As motion and long-during action tires
The sinewy vigor of the traveller.
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
And study too, the causer of your vow;
For where is any author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is:
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,

Do we not likewise see our learning there?
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with ?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
Lives not alone immured in the brain;
But, with the motion of all elements,
Courses as swift as thought in every power,
And gives to every power a double power,
Above their functions and their offices.
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails;
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books, the arts, the academes,
That show, contain and nourish all the world:
Else none at all in aught proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear,
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths,
It is religion to be thus forsworn,
For charity itself fulfils the law,
And who can sever love from charity?

 Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
In conflict that you get the sun of them.

 First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them,
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

 Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
And justice always whirls in equal measure:
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

Exeunt.
 Their eyes, villain, their eyes.

 Once to behold, rogue.

 Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
Exit Moth. 
 Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

 Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.

 We number nothing that we spend for you:
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
That we may do it still without accompt.
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
That we, like savages, may worship it.

 White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

 Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
There's half a dozen sweets.

 One word in secret.

 Thou grievest my gall.

 Therefore meet.

They converse apart.
 By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!

 This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
And utters it again when God doth please:
He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
A mean most meanly; and in ushering
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
This is the flower that smiles on every one,
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
And consciences, that will not die in debt,
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.

 See where it comes! Behaviour, what wert thou
Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?
 Re-enter the Princess, ushered by BOYET; ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE. 
 This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
By light we lose light: your capacity
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.

 I am a fool, and full of poverty.

 O, I am yours, and all that I possess!

 I cannot give you less.

 Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?

 Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
Can any face of brass hold longer out?
Here stand I: lady, dart thy skill at me;
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
I do forswear them; and I here protest,
By this white glove,--how white the hand, God knows!--
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

 Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
These lords are visited; you are not free,
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.

 Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.

 Peace! for I will not have to do with you.

 Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.

 Neither of either; I remit both twain.
I see the trick on't: here was a consent
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
The ladies did change favours: and then we,
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
We are again forsworn, in will and error.
Much upon this it is: and might not you

To Boyet.
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
Wounds like a leaden sword.

 Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
                 Enter COSTARD.
Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.

 What, are there but three?

 And three times thrice is nine.

 Is not nine.

  How much is it?

 Art thou one of the Worthies?

 Go bid them prepare.

 We are shame-proof, my lord: and 'tis some policy
To have one show worse than the king's and his company.

 A right description of our sport, my lord.
                 Enter ARMADO.
  There is five in the first show.

 Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.

 Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends with thee.

 My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
    Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander.
 Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.

 Pompey the Great,--

 Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.

 A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?

 Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.

 Because thou hast no face.

 A Death's face in a ring.

 Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.

 Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.

 False; we have given thee faces.

 An thou wert a lion, we would do so.

 For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!

  This cannot be Hector.

 A lemon.

     Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.

 Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
And by these badges understand the king.
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humors
Even to the opposed end of our intents:
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
As love is full of unbefitting strains,
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance:
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours, the error that love makes
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
By being once false for ever to be true
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

 And what to me, my love? and what to me?


 Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
What humble suit attends thy answer there:
Impose some service on me for thy love.

 To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be; it is impossible:
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.

 A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.

 Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
Might well have made our sport a comedy.

 That's too long for a play.
                Re-enter ARMADO.
"
96,duke-s.,DUKE,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/ayl.xml-duke-s.," Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court ?
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
I would not change it.

 Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
Being native burghers of this desert city,
Should in their own confines with forked heads
Have their round haunches gored.

 But what said Jaques?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?

 And did you leave him in this contemplation?

 Show me the place:
I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
For then he's full of matter.

 I think he be transform'd into a beast;
For I can no where find him like a man.

 If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.
Enter JAQUES.
 Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
That your poor friends must woo your company?
What, you look merrily!

 What fool is this?

 Thou shalt have one.

 Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.

 Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
That thou with license of free foot hast caught,
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

 Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
That in civility thou seem'st so empty ?

 What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
More than your force move us to gentleness.

 Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.

 True is it that we have seen better days,
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
And therefore sit you down in gentleness
And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be minister'd.

 Go find him out,
And we will nothing waste till you return.

 Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
This wide and universal theatre
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Wherein we play in.

 Welcome. Set down your venerable burden
And let him feed.

 Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
SONG.
 If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
And let me all your fortunes understand.
[Exeunt. Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
Can do all this that he hath promised?

 That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.

 I do remember in this shepherd boy
Some lively touches of my daughter's favor.

 I like him very well.

   If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.

 O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.

 Welcome, young man;
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
To one his lands withheld, and to the other
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
First, in this forest let us do those ends
That here were well begun and well begot:
And after, every of this happy number
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
According to the measure of their states.
Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
And fall into our rustic revelry.
Play, music!   And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.

 Stay, Jaques, stay.

 Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
A
s we do trust they'll end, in true delights.

EPILOGUE.
"
97,puck.,PUCK,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mnd.xml-puck.," How now, spirit! whither wander you?

 The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling;
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But they do square, that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.

 Thou speak'st aright;
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab,
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.

 I remember.

 I'll put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes. [Exit.
 Ay, there it is.

 Fear not, my lord, you servant shall do so.
                              [Exeunt.  Through the forest have I gone,
But Athenian found I none,
On whose eyes I might approve
This flower's force in stirring love.
Night and silence.--Who is here?
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
This is he, my master said,
Despised the Athenian maid;
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
On the dank and dirty ground.
Pretty soul! she durst not lie
Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
All the power this charm doth owe.
When thou wakest, let love forbid
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
So awake when I am gone;
For I must now to Oberon.
                            [Exit.
   Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running.
 What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.

 A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
                                [Exit. 
 I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
                                     [Exit.

 My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
When I did him at this advantage take,
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.

 I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
And the Athenian woman by his side:
That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
 Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS. 
 This is the woman, but not this the man.

 Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.

 I go, I go; look how I go,
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
                                    [Exit.
      Captain of our fairy band,
     Helena is here at hand;
     And the youth, mistook by me,
     Pleading for a lover's fee.
     Shall we their fond pageant see?
     Lord, what fools these mortals be!

      Then will two at once woo one;
     That must needs be sport alone;
     And those things do best please me
     That befall preposterously.
Enter Lysander and Helena.
 Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garment he had on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
And so far am I glad it so did sort
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.

 My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger:
At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
That in crossways and floods have burial,
Already to their wormy beds are gone;
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
They wilfully themselves exile from light
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.

 Up and down, up and down,
     I will lead them up and down:
     I am fear'd in field and town:
     Goblin, lead them up and down.
Here comes one.
 Re-enter LYSANDER.
 Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?

 Follow me, then,
To plainer ground.
[Exit Lysander, as following the voice.
             Re-enter DEMETRIUS.
 Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
I'll whip thee with a rod; he is defiled
That draws a sword on thee.

 Follow my voice; we'll try no manhood here.
                          [Exeunt. 
   Re-enter LYSANDER.
 Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?

 Come hither: I am here.

 Yet but three?   Come one more;
Two of both kinds makes up four.
Here she comes, curst and sad:
Cupid is a knavish lad,

Thus to make poor females mad.
  Re-enter HERMIA.
 On the ground
     Sleep sound:
     I'll apply
     To your eye,
     Gentle lover, remedy.
[Squeezing the juice on Lysander's eyes.
When thou wakest,
     Thou takest
     True delight
     In the sight
   Of thy former lady's eye:
   And the country proverb known,
   That every man should take his own,
   In your waking shall be shown:
     Jack shall have Jill;
     Nought shall go ill;
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

[Exit. 
 Now, when thou wakest, with thine own fool's eyes peep.

 Fairy king, attend, and mark:
     I do hear the morning lark.

 Now the hungry lion roars
And the wolf behowls the moon;
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
All with weary task fordone.
Now the wasted brands do glow,
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud.
Now it is the time of night
That the graves all gaping wide,
Every one lets forth his sprite,
In the church-way paths to glide:
And we fairies, that do run
By the triple Hecate's team,
From the presence of the sun,
Following darkness like a dream,
Now are frolic: not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
I am sent with broom before,
To sweep the dust behind the door.
Enter OBERON and TITANIA wlith their train.
 If we shadows have offended,
Think but this, and all is mended,
That you have but slumber'd here
While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
No more yielding but a dream,
Gentles, do not reprehend:
If you pardon, we will mend:
And, as I am an honest Puck,
If we have unearned luck
Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
We will make amends ere long;
Else the Puck a liar call;
So, good night unto you all.
Give me your hands, if we be friends,
And Robin shall restore amends.[Exit,
"
98,boyet.,BOYET,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/lll.xml-boyet.," Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
Consider who the king your father sends,
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you.

 Proud of employment, willingly I go.

 Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
He rather means to lodge you in the field,
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
To let you enter his unpeopled house.

Here comes Navarre.
Enter KING, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants. 
 So please your grace, the packet is not come
Where that and other specialties are bound:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

 The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.

 A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

 She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.

      Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
Exit Biron. 
 And every jest but a word.

 I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

 And wherefore not ships?
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

 So you grant pasture for me.
Offering to kiss her.
 Belonging to whom?

 If my observation, which very seldom lies,
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

 With that which we lovers entitle affected.

 Why, all his behaviours did make their retire
To the court of his eye, peeping through desire:
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

 But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclosed.
I only have made a mouth of his eye,
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.

 Do you hear, my mad wenches?

 What then, do you see?

 You are too hard for me.

Exeunt.
 I know not; but I think it was not he.

 Do not curst wives hold that selfsovereignty
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
Lords o'er their lords?

 Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
                Enter COSTARD.
 I am bound to serve.
This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
It is writ to Jaquenetta.

 Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
Submissive fall his princely feet before,
And he from forage will incline to play:
But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.

 I am much deceived but I remember the style.

 This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
To the prince and his bookmates.

 Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?

 Ay, my continent of beauty.

 My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
Finely put on!

 And who is your deer?

 But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?

  An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
An I cannot, another can.

 A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.

 An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.

 I fear too much rubbing.   Good night, my good owl.

Exeunt Boyet and Maria.
 O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?

 Prepare, madam, prepare!
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.

 Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The king and his companions: warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
And overheard what you shall overhear,
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
Action and accent did they teach him there;
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out;
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
A better speech was never spoke before;
Another, with his finger and his thumb,
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
To check their folly, passion's solemn tears.

 They do, they do; and are apparell'd thus,
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
And every one his love-feat will advance
Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
By favors several which they did bestow.

 Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part.

 The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
The Ladies mask. 
Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; the King, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked.

 Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.

 True; out indeed.

 They will not answer to that epithet;
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'

 What would you with the princess?

 Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

 She says, you have it, and you may be gone.

 They say, that they have measured many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass.

 If to come hither you have measured miles,
And many miles, the princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile.

 She hears herself.

 The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
As is the razor's edge invisible.
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
Above the sense of sense; so sensible
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.

 Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.

 Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
Immediately they will again be here
In their own shapes; for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity.

 They will, they will, God knows,
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
Therefore change favors; and, when they repair,
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.

 Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.

 Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.

 Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
Command me any service to her thither?

 I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
Exit. 
 Full merrily
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.

 You lie, you are not he.

 With libbard's head on knee.

 Your nose says, no, you are not; for it stands too right.

 Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.

 To make Judas hang himself.

 A cittern-head.

 The pommel of Caesar's falchion.

 Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?

   No; he is best indued in the small.

 Loves her by the foot.

 Renowned Pompey!

 "
99,pem.,The Earl of PEMBROKE,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-pem.," This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
Fresh expectation troubled not the land
With any long'd-for change or better state.

 But that your royal pleasure must be done,
This act is as an ancient tale new told,
And in the last repeating troublesome,
Being urged at a time unseasonable.

 When workmen strive to do better than well,
They do confound their skill in covetousness;
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
As patches set upon a little breach
Piscredit more in hiding of the fault
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.

 Then I, as one that am the tongue of these
To sound the purposes of all their hearts,
Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,
Your safety, for the which myself and them
Bend their best studies, heartily request
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
To break into this dangerous argument,--
If what in rest you have in right you hold,
Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend
The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
The rich advantage of good exercise?
That the time's enemies may not have this
To grace occasions, let it be our suit
That you have bid us ask his liberty;
Which for our goods we do no further ask
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
Enter HUBERT.
 This is the man should do the bloody deed;
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
The image of a wicked heinous fault
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
What we so feared he had a charge to do.

 And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.

 Indeed we heard how near his death he was
Before the child himself felt he was sick:
This must be answer'd either here or hence.

 Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,
And find the inheritance of this poor child,
His little kingdom of a forced grave.
That blood which owed the breath of all this isle,
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
This must not be thus borne: this will break out
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.  [Exeunt Lords.
 Who brought that letter from the cardinal ?

 Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.

 O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.

 All murders past do stand excused in this:
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
Shall give a holiness, a purity,
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.

 Cut him to pieces.

 There tell the king he may inquire us out.
[Exeunt Lords. 
 Up once again; put spirit in the French:
If they miscarry, we miscarry too.

 They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
Enter MELUN, wounded.
 It is the Count Melun.

 His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
That, being brought into the open air,
It would allay the burning quality
Of that fell poison which assaileth him.

 He is more patient
Than when you left him; even now he sung.

"
100,par.,PARIS,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-par.," Else might the world convince of levity 
As well my undertakings as your counsels:
But I attest the gods, your full consent
Gave wings to my propension and cut off
All fears attending on so dire a project.
For what, alas, can these my single arms?
What propugnation is in one man's valor,
To stand the push and enmity of those
This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
Were I alone to pass the difficulties
And had as ample power as I have will, 
Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
Nor faint in the pursuit. Sir, I propose not merely to myself
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
But I would have the soil of her fair rape
Wiped off, in honorable keeping her.
What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me, 
Now to deliver her possession up
On terms of base compulsion!   Can it be
That so degenerate a strain as this
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
There's not the meanest spirit on our party
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
Where Helen is the subject: then, I say, 
Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
The world's large spaces cannot parallel.           They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall, 
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector. Sweet, above thought I love thee. [Exeunt. See, ho! who is that there? A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--
Witness the process of your speech, wherein
You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
Did haunt you in the field. This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
What business, lord, so early? His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:
Let's have your company, or, if you please,
Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge-- 
My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
Rouse him and give him note of our approach,
With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
We shall be much unwelcome. There is no help;
The bitter disposition of the time
Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you. And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,
Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,
Myself or Menelaus? You are too bitter to your countrywoman. Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
But we in silence hold this virtue well,
We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
Here lies our way.
[Exeunt. It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
Tell you the lady what she is to do,
And haste her to the purpose. I know what 'tis to love;             
And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
Please you walk in, my lords.
[Exeunt.  [Within] Brother Troilus! Hark!   Hector's trumpet. 'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.
"
101,k.-john.,KING JOHN,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-k.-john.," Now, say Chatillon, what would France with us?

 Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.

 What follows if we disallow of this?

 Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
Controlment for controlment:  so answer France.

 Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
For ere thou canst report I will be there,
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:
So hence!   Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
And sullen presage of your own decay.
An honorable conduct let him have:
Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.
[Exeunt Chatillon and Pembroke.
 Our strong possession and our right for us.

 Let them approach.
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
This expedition's charge.
Enter ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE, and PHILIP his bastard brother.
What men are you?

 What art thou?

 Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
You came not of one mother then, it seems.

 A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?

 Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!

 Mine eye hath well examined his parts
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?

 Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him.
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's.
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
Being none of his, refuse him; this concludes;
My mother's son did get your father's heir;
Your father's heir must have your father's land.

 What is thy name?

 From henceforth bear his name
whose form thou bear'st:
Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.

 Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
For France, for France, for it is more than need.

 Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
Our just and lineal entrance to our own;
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct
Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.

 From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
To draw my answer from thy articles?

 Alack, thou dost usurp authority.

 My life as soon: do defy thee, France.
Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:
Submit thee, boy.

 Bedlam, have done.

 England, for itself.
You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects,--

 For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
These flags of France, that are advanced here
Before the eye and prospect of your town,
Have hither march'd to your endamagement:
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
All preparation for a bloody siege
And merciless proceeding by these French
Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
That as a waist doth girdle you about,
By the compulsion of their ordinance
By this time from their fixed beds of lime
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
But on the sight of us your lawful king,
Who painfully with much expedient march
Have brought a countercheck before your gates,
To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,
Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
To make a shaking fever in your walls,
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
To make a faithless error in your ears:
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
And let us in, your king, whose labor'd spirits,
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
Crave harborage within your city walls.

 Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.

 Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
And if not that, I bring you witnesses,
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--

 To verify our title with their lives.

 Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
That to their everlasting residence,
Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,
In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!

 Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth
In best appointment all our regiments.

 France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
Say, shall the current of our right run on?
Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,
Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,
Unless thou let his silver water keep
A peaceful progress to the ocean.

 Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?

 In us, that are our own great deputy,
And bear possession of our person here,
Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.

 Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers
And lay this Angiers even with the ground;
Then after fight who shall be king of it?

 We from the west will send destruction
Into this city's bosom.

 Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.

 If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen;
For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,
And all that we upon this side the sea,
Except this city now by us besieged,
Find liable to our crown and dignity,
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
In titles, honours and promotions,
As she in beauty, education, blood,
Holds hand with any princess of the world.

 What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?

 Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?

 Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,
With her to thee; and this addition more,
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.

 We will heal up all;
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;
Some speedy messenger bid her repair
To our solemnity: I trust we shall,
If not fill up the measure of her will,
Yet in some measure satisfy her so
That we shall stop her exclamation.
Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.
[Exeunt all but the Bastard.
 We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.
Enter PANDULPH.
 What earthly name to interrogatories
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,
To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,
So under Him that great supremacy,
Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
So tell the pope, all reverence set apart
To him and his usurp'd authority.

 Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
Though you and all the rest so grossly led
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
Against the pope and count his friends my foes.

 Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?

 The king is moved, and answers not to this.

 France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.

 Cousin, go draw our puissance together.       [Exit Bastard. 
France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;
A rage whose heat hath this condition,
That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,
The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.

 No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!        [Exeunt.  Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:
My mother is assailed in our tent,
And ta'en, I fear.

 So shall it be; your grace shall stay behind
So strongly guarded. [To Arthur] Cousin,
look not sad:
Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle will
As dear be to thee as thy father was.

  Cousin, away
for England! haste before:
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels
Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace
Must by the hungry now be fed upon:
Use our commission in his utmost force.

 Coz, farewell.   [Exit Bastard.
 Come hither, Hubert, O my gentle Hubert.
We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh
There is a soul counts thee her creditor
And with advantage means to pay thy love:
And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,
But I will fit it with some better t'me.
By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed
To say what good respect I have of thee.

 Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
I had a thing to say, but let it jo:
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
Attended with the pleasures of the world,
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
To give me audience: if the midnight bell
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
Sound on into the drowsy race of night:
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment
A passion hateful to my purposes,
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;
And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.

   Do not I know thou wouldst?
Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
On yon young boy:  I'll tell thee what, my friend,
He is a very serpent in my way;
And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,
He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
Thou art his keeper.

 Death.

 A grave.

 Enough.
I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;
Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:
Remember. Madam, fare you well:
I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.

 For England, cousin, go:
Hubert shall be your man, attend on you
With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!    [Exeunt. Here once again we sit, once again crowned,
And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.

 Some reasons of this double coronation
I have possess'd you with and think them strong;
And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
What you would have reform'd that is not well,
And well shall you perceive how willingly
I will both hear and grant you your request.

 Let it be so: I do commit his youth
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?  [Taking him apart.] 
 We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
Good lords, although my will to give is living,
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.

 Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?

 They burn in indignation.   I repent:
There is no sure foundation set on blood,
No certain life achieved by others' death.
Enter a Messenger.
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
Pour down thy weather: how   goes all in France?

 O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
Where hath it slept?   Where is my mother's care,
That such an army could be drawn in France,
And she not hear of it?

 Withhold   thy speed, dreadful occasion I
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
My discontented peers! WhatI mother deadly
How wildly then walks my estate in France!
Under whose conduct came those powers of France
That thou for truth givest out are landed here?

 Thou hast made me giddy
With these ill tidings.
Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret.
Now, what says the world
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
My head with more ill news, for it is full.

 Bear with me, cousin; for I was amazed
Under the tide: but now I breathe again
Aloft the flood, and can give audience
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.

 Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?

 Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
And on that day at noon, whereon he says
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.
Deliver him to safety; and return,
For I must use thee.
[Exeunt Hubert with Peter.
O my gentle cousin,
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived ?

 Gentle kinsman, go,
And thrust thyself into their companies:
I have a way to win their loves again;
Bring them before me.

 Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
O, let me have no subject enemies,
When adverse foreigners affright my towns
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
And fly like thought from them to me again.

 Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
And be thou he.

 My mother dead!
Re-enter HUBERT.
 Five moons!

 Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.

 It is the curse of kings to be attended
By slaves that take their humors for a warrant
To break within the bloody house of life,
And on the winking of authority
To understand a law, to know the meaning
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
More upon humor than advised respect.

 O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation!
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
Quoted and signed to do a deed of shame,
This murder had not come into my mind:
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
And thou, to be endeared to a king,
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.

 Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
When I spake darkly what I purposed,
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
As bid me tell my tale in express words,
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
But thou didst understand me by my signs
And didst in signs again parley with sin;
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
And consequently thy rude hand to act
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
Out of my sight, and never see me more!
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
Hostility and civil tumult reigns
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.

 Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
Throw this report on their incensed rage,
And make them tame to their obedience!
Forgive the comment that my passion made
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
O, answer not, but to my closet bring
The angry lords with all expedient haste.
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
[Exeunt. Thus have I yielded up into your hand
The circle of my glory.
[Giving the crown.
 Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
And from his holiness use all your power
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.
Our discontented counties do revolt;
Our people quarrel with obedience,
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
This inundation of mistemper'd humor
Rests by you only to be qualified:
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
That present medicine must be minister'd,
Or overthrow incurable ensues.

 Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
Say that before Ascension-day at noon
My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
I did suppose it should be on constraint:
But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.
Enter the BASTARD.
 Would not my lords return to me again,
After they heard young Arthur was alive?

 That villain Hubert told me he did live.

 The legate of the pope hath been with me,
And I have made a happy peace with him;
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
Led by the Dauphin.

 Have thou the ordering of this present time

 How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.

 This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
Enter a Messenger.
 Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.

 Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,
And will not let me welcome this good news.
Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;
Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
                 [Exeunt. Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
It would not out at windows nor at doors.
There is so hot a summer in my bosom,
That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
Upon a parchment, and against this fire
Do I shrink up.

 Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:
And none of you will bid the winter come
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,
I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
And so ingrateful, you deny me that.

 The salt in them is hot.
Within me is a hell; and there the poison
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
On unreprievable condemned blood.
Enter the BASTARD.
 O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
Are turned to one thread, one little hair:
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
And then all this thou seest is but a clod
And module of confounded royalty.

"
102,cant.,ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/h5.xml-cant.," My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
But that the scambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question.

 It must be thought on.   If it pass against us,
We lose the better half of our possession:
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the church
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
As much as would maintain, to the king's honor,
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
And to the coffers of the king beside,
A thousand pounds of the year: thus runs the bill.

 'Twould drink the cup and all.

 The king is full of grace and fair regard.

 The courses of his youth promised it not.
The breath no sooner left his father's body,
But that his wildness, mortified in him,
Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
Consideration, like an angel, came
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
Leaving his body as a paradise,
To envelope and contain celestial spirits.
Never was such a sudden scholar made;
Never came reformation in a flood,
With such a heady currance, scouring faults
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
As in this king.

 Hear him but reason in divinity,
And all-admiring with an inward wish
You would desire the king were made a prelate:
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
You would say it hath been all in all his study:
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
A fearful battle render'd you in music:
Turn him to any cause of policy,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
So that the art and practic part of life
Must be the mistress to this theoric:
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
Since his addiction was to courses vain,
His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
And never noted in him any study,
Any retirement, any sequestration
From open haunts and popularity.

 It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected.

 He seems indifferent,
Or rather swaying more upon our part
Than cherishing the exbibiters against us;
For I have made an offer to his majesty,
Upon our spiritual convocation
And in regard of causes now in hand,
Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
As touching France, to give a greater sum
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal.

 With good acceptance of his majesty;
Save that there was not time enough to hear,
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
The severals and unhidden passages
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
And generally to the crown and seat of France
Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.

 The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?

 Then go we in, to know his embassy;
Which I could with a ready guess declare,
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

 God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it!

 Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
That owe yourselves, your lives and services
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
To make against your highness' claim to France
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany,
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
There left behind and settled certain French;
Who, holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life,
Establish'd then this law: to wit, no female
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France:
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond,
Idly supposed the founder of this law;
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
Beyond the river Sala, in the year
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
Did, as heir general, being descended
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
Make claim and title to the crown of France.
Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
To find his title with some shows of truth,
Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was re-united to the crown of France.
So that, as clear as is the summer's sun,
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
To hold in right and title of the female:
So do the kings of France unto this day;
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your highness claiming from the female,
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.

 The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
When the man dies, let the inheritance
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
Stand for you own; unwind your bloody flag;
Look back into your mighty ancestors:
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
Making defeat on the full power of France,
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
Forage in blood of French nobility.
O noble English, that could entertain
With half their forces the full pride of France
And let another half stand laughing by,
All out of work and cold for action!

 O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
In aid whereof we of the spirituality
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors.

 They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.

 She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
For hear her but exampled by herself:
When all her chivalry hath been in France
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
She hath herself not only well defended
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.

 Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions,
Setting endeavour in continual motion;
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king and officers of sorts;
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold,
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
Delivering o'er to executors pale
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
That many things, having full reference
To one consent, may work contrariously:
As many arrows, loosed several ways,
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
As many lines close in the dial's centre;
So may a thousand actions, once afoot,
End in one purpose, and be all well borne
Without defeat.   Therefore to France, my liege.
Divide your happy England into four;
Whereof take you one quarter into France,
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
Let us be worried and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy.

"
103,tra.,TRANIO,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/shr.xml-tra.," Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only, good master, while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's checks
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics and the metaphysics,
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

 Master, some show to welcome us to town.
 Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by.
 Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

 Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

 I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold?

 Master, it is no time to chide you now;
Affection is not rated from the heart:
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

 Master you look'd so longly on the maid,
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.

 Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

 Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid.
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the father rid his hands of her,
Master, your love must live a maid at home;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.


 Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.


 Master, for my hand,
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

  You will be schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of the maid:
That's your device.

 Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
Visit his countrymen and banquet them?

 So had you need.
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
And I am tied to be obedient;
Because so well I love Lucentio.
For so your father charged me at our parting,
'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in another sense;
I am content to be Lucentio.
Because so well I love Lucentio.

 So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's,
 I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
But in all places else your master Lucentio.

 Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptisa Minola?

 Even he, Biondello.

 Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?

 I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.

 And if I be, sir, is it any offence?

 Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you?

 For what reason, I beseech you?

 Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
Do me this right; hear me with patience.
Baptista is a noble gentleman,
To whom my father is not all unknown;
And were his daughter fairer than she is,
She may more suitors have and me for one.
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

 No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.

 If it be so, sir, that you are the man
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
And if you break the ice and do this feat,
Achieve the elder, set the younger free
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

 Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
And do as adversaries do in law,
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

 Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
That being a stranger in this city here.
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
In the preferment of the eldest sister.
This liberty is all that I request,
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And free access and favour as the rest:
And, toward the education of your daughters,
I here bestow a simple instrument,
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
If you accept them, then their worth is great.

 Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.

 Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!

 'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

 And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.

 Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.

 But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

 That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only son:
If I may have your daughter to my wife,
I'll leave her houses three or four as good.
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

 Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
And twelve tight galleys: these will I assure her,
And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.

 Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.

 That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

 A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
Exit.
 Patience, good Katharine, and Baptista too.
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.

 But say, what to thine old news?

 'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

 Not so well apparell'd
As I wish you were.

 And tells  us, what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?

 See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; put on clothes of mine.

 He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
We will persuade him, be it possible,
To put on better ere he go to church.

 But to her love concerneth us to add
Her father's liking: which to bring to pass
As I before imparted to your worship,
I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
It skills not much, we'll fit him to our turn,--
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
And make assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised.
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.

 That by degrees we mean to look into,
And watch our vantage in this business:
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
The narrow-prying father, Minola,
The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
               Re-enter GREMIO.
Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

 And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

 Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.

 Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.

 What said the wench when he rose again?

 Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

 Of all mad matches never was the like.

 Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?

 Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

 O despiteful love! unconstant womankind
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

 Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since my eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

 And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!

 Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

 Mistress, we have.

 I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day.

 Ay, and he'll tame her.

 Faith, he is gone unto the tamingschool.

 Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
               Enter BIONDELLO.
                What is he, Biondello?

 If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he were the right Vincentio.
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca.
                 Enter a Pedant.
          And you, sir! you are welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?

 What countryman, I pray?

 Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your life?

 'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

 Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

 Among them know you one Vincentio?

 He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
 To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Look that you take upon you as you should;
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city:
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.

 Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
My father is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

Exeunt.
 Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?

 'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.

 Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty thoroughly, I advise you:
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.

 But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

 Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
 Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO.

Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
To the Pedant
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
I pray you, stand good father to me now,
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

 I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied and such assurance ta'en
And shall with either part's agreement stand?

 Then at my lodging, an it like you:
There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
We'll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here;
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

 Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.

>Exit Bion. 
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.

 Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

 How now! what's the matter?

    O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
Which runs himself and catches for his master.

 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

"
104,glou._k.-rich.,RICHARD,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/r3.xml-glou._k.-rich.," Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments:
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks.
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, which says that G
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here Clarence comes.
Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY.
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
That waits upon your grace?

 Upon what cause?

 Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?

 Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.

 Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
If we will keep in favor with the king,
To be her men and wear her livery:
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.

 Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
You may partake of any thing we say:
We speak no treason, man: we say the king
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
And that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks:
How say you, sir? can you deny all this?

 Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.

 Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?

 We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
And whatsoever you will employ me in,
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister.
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

 Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
I will deliver you, or else lie for you:
Meantime, have patience.

 Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return,
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here?   the new-deliver'd Hastings?
Enter LORD HASTINGS.
 As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?

 No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
For they that were your enemies are his,
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.

 What news abroad?

 Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
And overmuch consumed his royal person:
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
What, is he in his bed?

 Go you before, and I will follow you.
[Exit Hastings.
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to live:
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I: not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent,
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
But yet I run before my horse to market:
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
                                  [Exit. 
 Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

 Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.

 Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.

 Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

 Lady, you know no rules of charity,
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

 But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

 More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
Of these supposed evils, to give me leave,
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.

 Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

 By such despair, I should accuse myself.

 Say that I slew them not?

 I did not kill your husband.

 Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.

 I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
Which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.

 I grant ye.

 The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.

 Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
For he was fitter for that place than earth.

 Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

 Your bed-chamber.

 So will it, madam, till I lie with you.

 I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits.
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?

 Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your beauty, which did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world,
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

 These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
As all the world is cheered by the sun,
So I by that; it is my day, my life.

 Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.

 It is a quarrel most unnatural.
To be revenged on him that loveth you.

 He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
Did it to help thee to a better husband.

 He lives that loves thee better than he could.

 Plantagenet.

 The selfsame name, but one of better nature.

 Here. [She spitteth at him.]
Why dost thou spit at me?

 Never came poison from so sweet a place.

 Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

 I would they were, that I might die at once;
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,
No, when my father York and Edward wept,
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my father's death,
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks,
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing words;
But, now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak.
[She looks scornfully at him. 
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom,
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
[He lays his breast open: she offers at it  with his sword.
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
[Here she lets fall the sword.
Take up the sword again, or take up me.

 Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.

 Tush, that was in thy rage:
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.

 'Tis figured in my tongue.

 Then never man was true.

 Say, then, my peace is made.

 But shall I live in hope?

 Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

 Look, how this ring encompasseth thy finger,
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favor at thy gracious hand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.

 That it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,
Grant me this boon.

 Bid me farewell.

 Sirs, take up the corse.

 No, to White-Friars; there attend my coming.
[Exeunt all but Gloucester. 
Was ever woman in this humor woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humor won?
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford:
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this while:
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain some score or two of tailors,
To study fashions to adorn my body:
Since I am crept in favor with myself,
I will maintain it with some little cost.
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass. [Exit. They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
Who are they that complain unto the king,
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
But thus his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

 To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all!   His royal person,--
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

 I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
Since every Jack became a gentleman,
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.

 Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
Myself disgraced, and the nobility
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.

 You may deny that you were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

 She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that:
She may help you to many fair preferments,
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honors on your high deserts.
What may she not?   She may, yea, marry, may she,--

 What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
I wis your grandam had a worser match.

 What! threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.

 Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
To royalise his blood I spilt mine own.

 In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere now, and what you are;
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.

 Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

 To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine:
I am too childish-foolish for this world.

 If I should be!   I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!

 Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?

 Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

 The curse my noble father laid on thee,
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland,--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

 Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

 Margaret.

 Ha!

 I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.

 'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

 Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.

 Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.

 What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

 I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her.

 But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good,
That is too cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains:
God pardon them that are the cause of it!

 So do I ever: [Aside]being well advised
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
Enter CATESBY.
 I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls;
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
Enter two Murderers.
But, soft! here come my executioners.
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?

 Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
[Gives the warrant. 
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

 Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
I like you, lads; about your business straight;
Go, go, dispatch.

 Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!

 A blessed labor, my most sovereign liege:
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
Hold me a foe;
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
By any in this presence, I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity:
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
That all without desert have frown'd on me;
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born to-night:
I thank my God for my humility.

 Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this,
To be so flouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
                           [They all start.
You do him injury to scorn his corse.

 But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
And that a winged Mercury did bear;
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
That came too lag to see him buried.
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
And yet go current from suspicion!
Enter DERBY.
 This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O, they did urge it still unto the king!
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
To comfort Edward with our company.

 Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star;
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing.

 Amen; and make me die a good old man!
That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
I marvel why her grace did leave it out.

 I hope the king made peace with all of us;
And the compact is firm and true in me.

 Then be it so; and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
To give your censures in this weighty business?

 My other self, my counsel's consistory,
My oracle, my prophet!   My dear cousin,
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.
                           [Exeunt.  Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign:
The weary way hath made you melancholy.

 Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts:
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!

 My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
Enter the Lord Mayor, and his train.
 Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I may counsel you, some day or two
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and recreation.

 So wise so young, they say, do never live long.

 I say, without characters, fame lives long.
[Aside]Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
I moralize two meanings in one word.

 Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL.
 How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?

 He hath, my lord.

 O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.

 He may command me as my sovereign;
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.

 My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.

 A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.

 Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.

 It is too heavy for your grace to wear.

 What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

 How?

 My lord, will't please you pass along?
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother, to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

 Why, what should you fear?

 Nor none that live, I hope,

 No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable:
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.

 Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

 Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

 At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
                         [Exit Catesby. 
 Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.

 And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form.
                              [Exeunt. My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
My absence doth neglect no great designs,
Which by my presence might have been concluded.

 Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.

 My lord of Ely!

 When I was last in Holborn,
I saw good strawberries in your garden there:
I do beseech you send for some of them.

 Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
[Drawing him aside. 
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
As he will lose his head ere give consent
His master's son, as worshipful he terms it,
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

 I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
Upon my body with their hellish charms?

 Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

 If! thou protector of this damned strumpet,
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'? Thou art a traitor:
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
I will not dine until I see the same.
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
[Exeunt all but Hastings, Ratcliff, and Lovel.

 Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy color,
Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
And then begin again, and stop again,
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?

 He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
Enter the Mayor and CATESBY. 
 Look to the drawbridge there!

 Catesby, o'erlook the walls.

 Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.

 Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head.
 So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts:
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
He lived from all attainder of suspect.

 What, think you we are Turks or infidels?
Or that we would, against the form of law,
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
But that the extreme peril of the case,
The peace of England and our persons' safety,
Enforced us to this execution?

 Yet had not we determined he should die,
Until your lordship came to see his death;
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens, who haply may
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.

 And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
To avoid the carping censures of the world.

 Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
Only for saying he would make his son
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
Which, by the sign thereof, was termed so.
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury,
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
Without control, listed to make his prey.
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
Tell them, when that my mother went with child
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
My princely father then had wars in France;
And, by just computation of the time,
Found that the issue was not his begot;
Which well appeared in his lineaments,
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.

 If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's castle;
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.

 Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
[To Cate.] Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
                    [Exeunt all but Gloucester.
Now will I in, to take some privy order,
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
And to give notice, that no manner of person
At any time have recourse unto the princes.
                                   [Exit. How now, my lord, what say the citizens?

 Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?

 Ah! and did they so?

 What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?

 Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?

 I go; and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself,
No doubt we'll bring it to a happy issue.

 My lord, there needs no such apology:
I rather do beseech you pardon me,
Who, earnest in the service of my God,
Neglect the visitation of my friends.
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

 I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

 Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

 I know not whether to depart in silence,
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof,
Best fitteth my degree or your condition:
If not to answer, you might haply think
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
So season'd with your faithful love to me,
Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
Definitively thus I answer you.
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
First, if all obstacles were cut away,
And that my path were even to the crown,
As my ripe revenue and due by birth;
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
So mighty and so many my defects,
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
And in the vapor of my glory smother'd.
But, God be thanked, there's no need of me,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
Will well become the seat of majesty,
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
On him I lay what you would lay on me,
The right and fortune of his happy stars;
Which God defend that I should wring from him!

 Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
I am unfit for state and majesty:
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
I cannot nor I will not yield to you,

 O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
[Exit Buckingham   with the Citizens,
 Would you enforce me to a world of care?
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
But penetrable to your kind entreats,
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest.
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
I must have patience to endure the load:
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition,
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
For God he knows, and you may partly see,
How far I am from the desire thereof,

 In saying so, you shall but say the truth.

 Even when you please, since you will have it so.

 Come, let us to our holy task again.
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.
                             [Exeunt. 
 Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham!

 Give me thy hand.   [Here he ascendeth his throne.]
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
But shall we wear these honors for a day?
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?

 O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
To try if thou be current gold indeed:
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.

 Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king.

 Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.

 O bitter consequence,
That Edward still should live!   'True, noble prince!'
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.

 Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?

 I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys: none are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes:
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!

 Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?

 What is his name?

 I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
[Exit Page. 
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
No more shall be the neighbor to my counsel:
Hath he so long held out with me untired,
And stops he now for breath?
Enter STANLEY.
How now! what news with you?

 Catesby!

 Rumor it abroad
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
I will take order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
About it; for it stands me much upon,
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
[Exit Catesby. 
I must be married to my brother's daughter,
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
Uncertain way of gain!   But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
Re-enter Page, with TYRREL.
Is thy name Tyrrel?

 Art thou, indeed?

 Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

 Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

 Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel:
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
[Whispers.
There is no more but so: say it is done,
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.

 Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?

 Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.

 Stanley, he is your wife's son: well, look to it.

 Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.

 As I remember, Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
A king, perhaps, perhaps,--

 How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?

 Richmond!   When last I was at Exeter,
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
Because a bard of Ireland told me once,
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.

 Ay, what's o'clock?

 Well, but what's o'clock?

 Well, let it strike.

 Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein to-day.

 Tut, tut.
Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
[Exeunt all but Buckingham.
 Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

 But didst thou see them dead?

 And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

 Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
And be inheritor of thy desire.
Farewell till soon.
[Exit Tyrrel.
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
Enter CATESBY.
 Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?

 Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary:
Then fiery expedition be my wing,
Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
                             [Exeunt.  Who intercepts my expedition?

 A flourish, trumpets!   strike alarum, drums!
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's anointed: strike, I say!
[Flourish. Alarums.
Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus will I drown your exclamations.

 Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

 Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.

 Do then; but I'll not hear.

 And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.

 And came I not at last to comfort you?

 Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your sight,
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
Strike up the drum.

 You speak too bitterly.

 So.

 Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.

 You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

 Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.

 Her life is only safest in her birth.

 Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.

 All unavoided is the doom of destiny.

 You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.

 Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
As I intend more good to you and yours
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!

 The advancement of your children, gentle lady.

 No, to the dignity and height of honor,
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.

 Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.

 Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.

 What do you think?

 Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
And mean to make her queen of England.

 Even he that makes her queen: who should be else?

 I, even I: what think you of it, madam?

 That would I learn of you,
As one that are best acquainted with her humor.

 Madam, with all my heart.

 Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
To win your daughter.

 Say that I did all this for love of her.

 Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
Which after hours give leisure to repent.
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
To make amends, I'll give it to your daughter.
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter:
A grandam's name is little less in love
Than is the doting title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below,
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
Your children were vexation to your youth,
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
The loss you have is but a son being king,
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
I cannot make you what amends I would,
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
This fair alliance quickly shall call home
To high promotions and great dignity:
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
Again shall you be mother to a king,
And all the ruins of distressful times
Repair'd with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again, transformed to orient pearl,
Advantaging their loan with interest
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys:
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
To whom I will retail my conquest won.
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.

 Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

 Say that the king, which may command, entreats.

 Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.

 Say, I will love her everlastingly.

 Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.

 So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

 Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.

 Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

 Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.

 Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.

 Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.

 Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--

 I swear--

 Now, by the world--

 My father's death--

 Then, by myself--

 Why then, by God--

 The time to come.

 As I intend to prosper and repent,
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
In her consists my happiness and thine;
Without her, follows to this land and me,
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
It cannot be avoided but by this;
It will not be avoided but by this.
Therefore, good mother,--I must call you so--
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
Urge the necessity and state of times,
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.

 Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.

 Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.

 But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

 And be a happy mother by the deed.

 Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
[Exit Queen Elizabeth. 
Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following.
How now! what news?

 Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?

 Fly to the duke: [To Ratcliff]
Post thou to Salisbury:
When thou comest thither,--[To Catesby]
Dull, unmindful villain,
Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?

 O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
The greatest strength and power he can make,
And meet me presently at Salisbury.

 Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?

 My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
Enter LORD STANLEY.
How now, what news with you?

 Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
Why dost thou run so many mile about,
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
Once more, what news?

 There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?

 Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?

 Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
What heir of York is there alive but we?
And who is England's king but great York's heir?
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?

 Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.

 Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore,
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?

 Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?

 Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
I will not trust you, sir.

 Well,
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm,
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.

 Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death? [He striketh him. 
Take that, until thou bring me better news.

 I cry thee mercy:
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
Reward to him that brings the traitor in?

 March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
If not to fight with foreign enemies,
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
Re-enter CATESBY.
 Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
A royal battle might be won and lost:
Some one take order Buckingham be brought
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
[Flourish. Exeunt Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?

 My Lord of Norfolk,--

 Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?

 Up with my tent there! here will I lie to-night;
But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the foe?

 Why, our battalion trebles that account:
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
Which they upon the adverse party want.
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
Let us survey the vantage of the field;
Call for some men of sound direction:
Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.
[Exeunt.
Enter, on the other side of the field, RICHMOND, SIR WILLIAM BRANDON, OXFORD, and others, Some of the Soldiers pitch Richmond's tent.
 What is't o'clock?

 I will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and paper.
What, is my beaver easier than it was?
And all my armor laid into my tent?

 Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

 Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.

 Catesby!

 Send out a pursuivant at arms
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
[Exit Catesby.
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
Ratcliff!

 Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?

 So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
I have not that alacrity of spirit,
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

 Bid my guard watch; leave me.
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
[Exeunt Ratcliff and the other Attendants.
Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent, Lords and others attending.
 Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear? myself? there's none else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am:
Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why:
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? for any good
That I myself have done unto myself?
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a villain: yet I lie, I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;
Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree;
All several sins, all used in each degree,
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
Find in myself no pity to myself?
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
Came to my tent; and every one did threat
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
Enter RATCLIFF.
 'Zounds! who is there?

 O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?

 O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--

 By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
To see if any mean to shrink from me.
[Exeunt.
Enter the Lords to RICHMOND, sitting in his tent.
 What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

 He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?

 He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
[Clock striketh. 
Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun to-day?

 Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
He should have braved the east an hour ago:
A black day will it be to somebody.
Ratcliff!

 The sun will not be seen to-day;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
More than to Richmond? for the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
Enter NORFOLK.
 Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
And thus my battle shall be ordered:
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
Consisting equally of horse and foot;
Our archers shall be placed in the midst:
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
They thus directed, we will follow
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
This, and Saint George to boot!   What think'st thou, Norfolk?

 'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
A thing devised by the enemy.
Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge:
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell;
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
His oration to his Army.
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
Remember whom you are to cope withal;
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
They would restrain the one, distain the other.
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?
A milk-sop, one that never in his life
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters?[Drum afar off.]
Hark! I hear their drum.
Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yeoman!
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
Enter a Messenger.
What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power

 Off with his son George's head!

 A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
Advance our standards, set upon our foes;
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.
[Exeunt. A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

 Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
[Exeunt."
105,prin.,ESCALUS,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/rom.xml-prin.," Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Will they not hear?   What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince,
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You, Capulet, shall go along with me:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

Exeunt all but Montague, Lady Montague, and Benvolio.
 Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

 Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

 Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

 And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body, and attend our will:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

Exeunt.
 What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others.
 What fear is this which startles in our ears?

 Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

 Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.
Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?

 Look, and thou shalt see.
Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave?

 Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

 Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

 We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

 Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

 This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies?   Capulet!   Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

 A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show   his head:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

Exeunt.
"
106,bast.,PHILIP the BASTARD,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/jn.xml-bast.," Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge.
A soldier, by the honor-giving hand
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.

 Most certain of one mother, mighty king,
That is well known; and, as I think, one father:
But for the certain knowledge of that truth
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.

 I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
Heaven guard my mother's honor and my land!

 I know not why, except to get the land,
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
But whether I be as true begot or no,
That still I lay upon my mother's head;
But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
If old sir Robert did beget us both
And were our father and this son like him,
O old sir Robert, father, on my knee
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!

 Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
With half that face would he have all my land:
A half-faced groat five hundred pounds a year!

 Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.

 Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
Than was his will to get me, as I think.

 Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
My arm such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
Would I might never stir from off this place,
I would give it every foot to have this face;
I would not be sir Nob in any case.

 Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
Madam, I'll follow   you unto the death.

 Our country manners give our betters way.

 Philip, my liege, so is my name begun;
Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.

 Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,
When I was got, sir Robert was away!

 Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
Something about, a little from the right,
In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
And have is have, however men do catch:
Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
And I am I, however I was begot.

 Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
[Exeunt all but Bastard.
A fool or honour better than I was;
But many a many foot of land the worse.
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
'Good den, sir Richard!--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
For new-made honour doth forget men's names;
'Tis too respective and too sociable
For your conversion. Now your traveller,
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;
And then comes answer like an Absey book:
'O yes,' says answer, 'at your best command;
At your employment; at your service, sir:'
'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:
And so, ere answer knows what question would,
Saving a dialogue of compliment,
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
The Pyrenean and the river Po,
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
But this is worshipful society
And fits the mounting spirit like myself:
For he is but a bastard to the time
That doth not smack of observation;
And so am I, whether I smack or no;
And not alone in habit and device,
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
But from the inward motion to deliver
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and JAMES GURNEY.
O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!
What brings you here to court so hastily?

 My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?

                 Philip! sparrow: James,
There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
[Exit Gurney.
Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
Could he get me?   Sir Robert could not do it:
We know   his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.

 Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.
But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;
I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;
Legitimation, name and all is gone:
Then, good my mother, let me know my father:
Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?

 As faithfully as I deny the devil.

  Now, by this light, were I to get again,
Madam, I would not wish a better father.
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
Subjected tribute to commanding love,
Against whose fury and unmatched force
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
 And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:
 Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.
[Exeunt. Hear the crier.

 One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
An a' may catch your hide and you alone:
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard:
I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;
Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.

 It lies as sightly on the back of him
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:
But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.

 Bastards, and else.

 Some bastards too.

 Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since
Sits on his horse back at mine hostess' door,
Teach us some fence!   [To Aust.] Sirrah, were I at home,
At your den, sirrah, with your lioness,
I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,
And make a monster of you.

 O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar.

 Speed then, to take advantage of the field.

 Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
In undetermined differences of kings.
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
Cry, 'havoc!' kings: back to the stained field,
You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
Then let confusion of one part confirm
The other's peace; till then, blows, blood and death!

 By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
And stand securely on their battlements,
As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
Your royal presences be ruled by me:
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
By east and west let France and England mount
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
Even till unfenced desolation
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
That done, dissever your united strengths,
And part your mingled colors once again;
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
Out of one side her happy minion,
To whom in favour she shall give the day,
And kiss him with a glorious victory.
How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
Smacks it not something of the policy?

 An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
Being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town,
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
Why then defy each other, and pell-mell
Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.

 O prudent discipline!   From north to south:
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:
I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!

 Here's a stay
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;
He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
But buffets better than a fist of France:
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.

 Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy
 Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
That, hang'd and drawn and quarter'd, there should be
In such a love so vile a lout as he.

 Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
Hath willingly departed with a part,
And France, whose armor conscience buckled on,
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
Who, having no external thing to lose
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,
That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
Commodity, the bias of the world,
The world, who of itself is peised well,
Made to run even upon even ground,
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
This sway of motion, this Commodity,
Makes it take head from all indifferency,
From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
And this same bias, this Commodity,
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
From a resolved and honorable war,
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
And why rail I on this Commodity?
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
When his fair angels would salute my palm;
But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
And say there is no sin but to be rich;
And being rich, my virtue then shall be
To say there is no vice but beggary.
Since kings break faith upon commodity,
Gain, by my lord, for I will worship thee.
[Exit. And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.

 And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.

 And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.

 Your breeches best may carry them.

 Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.

 Will 't not be?
Will not a calf's-skin stop that mouth of thine?

 Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
Is it as he will? well, then, France shall rue.

 Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
Some airy devil hovers in the sky
And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,
While Philip breathes.
Enter KING JOHN, ARTHUR, and HUBERT.
             My lord, I rescued her;
Her highness is in safety, fear you not:
But on, my liege; for very little pains
Will bring this labor to a happy end.
[Exeunt. Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,
When gold and silver becks me to come on.
I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,
If ever I remember to be holy,
For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.

 But if you be afraid to hear the worst,
Then let the worst unheard fall on your head.

 How I have sped among the clergymen,
The sums I have collected shall express.
But as I travell'd hither through the land,
I find the people strangely fantasied;
Possess'd with rumors, full of idle dreams,
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
And here's a prophet, that I brought with me
>From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found

With many hundreds treading on his heels;
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
Your highness should deliver up your crown.

 The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
And others more, going to seek the grave
Of Arthur, whom they say is kill'd to-night
On your suggestion.

 I will seek them out.

 The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
[Exit. 
 Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
The king by me requests your presence straight.

 Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.

 But there is little reason in your grief;
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.

 'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.

 It is a damned and a bloody work;
The graceless action of a heavy hand,
If that it be the work of any hand.

 Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.

 Keep the peace, I say.

 Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:
If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.

 Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
Art thou damned, Hubert.

 Ha! I'll tell thee what;
Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.

 If thou didst but consent
To this most cruel act, do but despair;
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
That ever spider twisted from her womb
Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
Put but a little water in a spoon,
And it shall be as all the ocean,
Enough to stifle such a villain up.
I do suspect thee very grievously.

 Go, bear him in thine arms.
I am amazed, methinks, and lost my way
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
How easy dost thou take all England up!
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
The life, the right and truth of all this realm
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
Now powers from home and discontents at home
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.
                  [Exeunt. All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
But Dover castle: London hath received,
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:
Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
To offer service to your enemy,
And wild amazement hurries up and down
The little number of your doubtful friends.

 They found him dead and cast into the streets,
An empty casket, where the jewel of life
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.

 So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,
That borrow their behaviors from the great,
Grow great by your example and put on
The dauntless spirit of resolution.
Away, and glister like the god of war,
When he intendeth to become the field:
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
And fright him there? and make him tremble there ?
O, let it not be said: forage, and run
To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.

 O inglorious league!
Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
Send fair-play orders and make compromise,
Insinuation, parley and base truce
To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
Mocking the air with colors idly spread,
And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms:
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
Or if he do, let it at least be said
They saw we had a purpose of defence.

 Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,
Our party may well meet a prouder foe.
                   [Exeunt. According to the fair play of the world,
Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:
My holy lord of Milan, from the king
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;
And, as you answer, I do know the scope
And warrant limited unto my tongue.

 By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
He is prepared, and reason too he should:
This apish and unmannerly approach,
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
From out the circle of his territories.
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
To fierce and bloody inclination.

 No, I will speak.

 Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
And so shall you, being beaten: do but start
An echo with the clamor of thy drum,
And even at hand a drum is ready braced
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
Sound but another, and another shall
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,
Not trusting to this halting legate here,
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.

 And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.
                              [Exeunt.  A friend. What art thou?

 Who thou wilt: and if thou please,
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
I come one way of the Plantagenets.

 Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad ?

 Brief, then; and what's the news?

 Show me the very wound of this ill news:
I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.

 How did he take it? who did taste to him ?

 Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty ?

 Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
And tempt us not to bear above our power!
I'll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.
Away before: conduct me to the king;
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
                 [Exeunt. O, I am scalded with my violent motion,
And spleen of speed to see your majesty!

 The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;
For in a night the best part of my power,
As I upon advantage did remove,
Were in the Washes all unwarily
Devoured by the unexpected flood.
             [The king dies.
 Art thou gone so?   I do but stay behind
To do the office for thee of revenge,
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,
And instantly return with me again,
To push destruction and perpetual shame
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.

 He will the rather do it when he sees
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.

 Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
With other princes that may best be spared,
Shall wait upon your father's funeral.

 Thither shall it then:
And happily may your sweet self put on
The lineal state and glory of the land!
To whom, with all submission, on my knee
I do bequeath my faithful services
And true subjection everlastingly.

 O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
This England never did, nor never shall,
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
But when it first did help to wound itself.
Now these her princes are come home again,
Come the three corners of the world in arms,
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
If England to itself do rest but true.
                    [Exeunt."
107,hect.,HECTOR,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-hect.," Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
As far as toucheth my particular,Yet, dread Priam,                            
There is no lady of more softer bowels,
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
If we have lost so many tenths of ours,      
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
Had it our name, the value of one ten,
What merit's in that reason which denies
The yielding of her up? Brother, she is not worth what she doth costThe holding. But value dwells not in particular will;
It holds his estimate and dignity
As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
To make the service greater than the god;
And the will dotes that is attributive
To what infectiously itself affects,
Without some image of the affected merit.  It is Cassandra.                    
           Enter CASSANDRA, raving. Peace, sister, peace! Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
Of divination in our sister work
Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
Can qualify the same? Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
And on the cause and question now in hand
Have glozed, but superficially: not much
Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
The reasons you allege do more conduce
To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
Than to make up a free determination      
'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Of any true decision. Nature craves
All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
What nearer debt in all humanity
Than wife is to the husband? If this law
Of nature be corrupted through affection,
And that great minds, of partial indulgence
To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
There is a law in each well-order'd nation 
To curb those raging appetites that are
Most disobedient and refractory.
If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
As it is known she is, these moral laws
Of nature and of nations speak aloud
To have her back return'd: thus to persist
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,
My spritely brethren, I propend to you     
In resolution to keep Helen still,
For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependence
Upon our joint and several dignities. I am yours,
You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
I was advertised their great general slept, 
Whilst emulation in the army crept:
This, I presume, will wake him.
[Exeunt. Why, then will I no more:
Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;   
The obligation of our blood forbids
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,
And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member 
Wherein my sword had not impressure made
Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:
By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
Cousin, all honor to thee! Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
A thought of added honor torn from Hector. We'll answer it;
The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell. AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
And signify this loving interview
To the expecters of our Trojan part;
Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
 The worthiest of them tell me name by name; 
But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
Shall find him by his large and portly size. I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon. Who must we answer? O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;
Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.  O, pardon; I offend. Let me enbrace thee, good old chronicle,
That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee. I would they could. I know your favor, Lord Ulysses, well.
Ah, sir, there 's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
Since I first saw yourself and Diomed
In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy. I must not believe you:
There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
And that old common arbitrator, Time,
Will one day end it. Is this Achilles? Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee. Nay, I have done already. O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
But there's more in me than thou understand'st. 
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye? It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
To answer such a question: stand again:
Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
As to prenominate in nice conjecture       
Where thou wilt hit me dead? Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
I'll not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;
For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
His insolence draws folly from my lips;
But I'll endeavor deeds to match these words,
Or may I never-- I pray you, let us see you in the field:
We have had pelting wars, since you refused
The Grecians' cause. Thy hand upon that match.  I trouble you. Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.  Good night, sweet Lord Menelaus. Give me your hand. And so, good night.
[Exit Diomedes; Ulysses and Troilus following. You train me to offend you; get you in:
By all the everlasting gods, I'll go! No more, I say.
               Enter CASSANDRA. Ho! bid my trumpet sound. Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear. Hold you still, I say;
Mine honor keeps the weather of my fate:
Life every man holds dear; but the brave man
Holds honor far more precious-dear than life.
                Enter TROILUS.
How now, young man!   mean'st thou to fight to-day? No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth, 
I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
Let grow thy sinews till knots be strong,
And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy. What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it. O, 'tis fair play. How now! how now! Fie, savage, fie! Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.  AEneas is a-field;
And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
Even in the faith of valor, to appear
This morning to them. I must not break my faith.         
You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
To take that course by your consent and voice,
Which you do forbid me, royal Priam. Andromache, I am offended with you:
Upon the love you bear me, get you in.                             
[Exit Andromache.  You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night. What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?
Art thou of blood and honor?  Yea, Troilus?   O, well fought, my youngest brother!
                Enter ACHILLES. Pause, if thou wilt. Fare thee well:
I would have been much more a fresher man,
Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!
               Re-enter TROILUS. Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
No? wilt thou not?   I like thy armor well;
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not, beast, abide? 
Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
[Exeunt.
 Most putrefied core, so fair without,
Thy goodly armor thus hath cost thy life.
Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him.
 Enter ACHILLES and Myrmidons. I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek."

Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Have we march'd on without impediment;
And here receive we from our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn:
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war,

 All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

 If without peril it be possible,
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
And give him from me this most needful scroll.

 Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come, gentlemen,
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business:
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
[They withdraw into the tent.
Enter, to his tent, KING RICHARD, NORFOLK, RATCLIFF, CATESBY, and others.

 Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
When I should mount with wings of victory:
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
[Exeunt all but Richmond. 
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
That we may praise thee in the victory!
To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
[Sleeps.

 Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.

 The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
I promise you, my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it, lords?

 Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
His oration to his soldiers.
More than I have said, loving countrymen,
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
God and our good cause fight upon our side;
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
One that made means to come by what he hath,
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever been God's enemy:
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against your country's foes,
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
If you do free your children from the sword,
Your children's children quit it in your age.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George!   Richmond and victory!

 God and your arms be praised, victorious friends;
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.

 Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?

 What men of name are slain on either side?

 Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in submission will return to us:
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
We will unite the white rose and the red:
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
The father rashly slaughtered his own son,
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
All this divided York and Lancaster,
Divided in their dire division,
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
The true succeeders of each royal house,
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
And let their heirs, God, if they will be so,
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
That would reduce these bloody days again,
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
Let them not live to taste this land's increase
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:
That she may long live here, God say amen!

 A piece of him.

 Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

 Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

 Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.

 What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!

 Stay! speak, speak!   I charge thee, speak!
Exit Ghost. 
 Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.

 As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on        
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.

 In what particular thought to work I know not:
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

 That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet—
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him—
Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent      
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other—
As it doth well appear unto our state—    
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

 A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: 
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on.
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.—
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!

Re-enter Ghost.
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,   
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:

Cock crows.
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

 Do, if it will not stand.

 'Tis here!

 And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, 
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.

 So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, 
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

 Hail to your lordship!

 The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

 A truant disposition, good my lord.

 My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

 Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.

 Where, my lord?

 I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

 My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

 My lord, the king your father.

 Season your admiration for a while
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.

 Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernado, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter'd.   A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,          
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch:
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good, 
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.

 My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from our sight.

 As I do live, my honor'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.

 O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.

 A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

 Nay, very pale.

 Most constantly.

 It would have much amazed you.

 While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

 Not when I saw 't.

 It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.

 I warrant it will.

 It is a nipping and an eager air.

 I think it lacks of twelve.

 Indeed?   I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within.
What does this mean, my lord?

 Is it a custom?

 Look, my lord, it comes!

Enter Ghost.
 It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.

 No, by no means.

 Do not, my lord.

 What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff   
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? think of it:
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more motive, into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.

 Be ruled; you shall not go.

 He waxes desperate with imagination.

 Have after. To what issue will this come?

 Heaven will direct it.

 Heaven secure him!

 Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

 What news, my lord?

 Good my lord, tell it.

 Not I, my lord, by heaven.

 There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this.

 These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

 There's no offence, my lord.

 What is't, my lord? we will.

 In faith,
My lord, not I.

 Propose the oath, my lord.

 O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

  O, my dear lord,—

 Well, my lord:
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

     'Twere good she were spoken with: for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

 What are they that would speak with me?

 Let them come in.
[Exit Servant.
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
                 Enter Sailors.
            Good my lord, be quiet.
[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.
 Remember it, my lord!

 That is most certain.

 Is't possible?

 I beseech you.

 Ay, good my lord.

 How was this seal'd?

 So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

 Why, what a king is this!

 It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.

 Peace! who comes here? 
                  Enter OSRIC.
         They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

 Never believe it:     
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
Here's yet some liquor left.

 Now cracks a noble heart.   Good night, sweet prince; 
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?
[March within.
 Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,  and others.

 What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

 Not from his mouth,
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Are here arrived, give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view; 
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about: so shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgements, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall'n on the inventor's heads: all this can I
Truly deliver.

 Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance,
On plots and errors, happen.

"
110,cor-4,"Aufidius, Tullus",Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/cor.xml-cor-4," Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state,
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
Reads
'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
Cominius Marcius your old enemy,
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
These three lead on this preparation
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'

 Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must show themselves; which in the hatching,
It seem'd, appeared to Rome. By the discovery
We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.

 O, doubt not that;
I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
Some parcels of their power are forth already,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
Till one can do no more. And keep your honours safe!

 We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

 If I fly, Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.

 Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.

They fight and certain Volsces come in the aid of Aufidius. Marcius fights till they be driven in breathless. 
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
In your condemned seconds.
Exeunt.
 The town is ta'en!

 Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
What good condition can a treaty find
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
As often as we eat. By the elements,
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.

 Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
The prayers of priests nor time of sacrifice,
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
Against the hospitable canon, would I
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.

 I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you—
'Tis south the city mills—bring me word thither
How the world goes, that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey.

 Where is this fellow?

 Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

 What is thy name?

 Say, what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn,
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name ?

 I know thee not: thy name?

 O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say ‘’Tis true,’ I'ld not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke,
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm for't: thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me:
We have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who am prepared against your territories,
Though not for Rome itself.

 Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenge, take
The one half of my commission; and set down—
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
Thy country's strength and weakness,—thine own ways;
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

Exeunt Coriolanus and Aufidius. The two Servingmen come forward.
 Do they still fly to the Roman?

 I cannot help it now,
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
Even to my person, than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.

 I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
When he shall come to his account, he knows not
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly,
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
Whene'er we come to our account.

 All places yield to him ere he sits down;
And the nobility of Rome are his:
The senators and patricians love him too:
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to them; but he could not
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
The happy man; whether defect of judgement,
To fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
Not to be other than one thing, not moving
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of these—
As he hath spices of them all, not all,
For I dare so far free him—made him fear'd,
So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
Lie in the interpretation of the time:
And power, unto itself most commendable,
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
To extol what it hath done.
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.
Exeunt. 
 You keep a constant temper.

Exeunt Coriolanus and Aufidius.
 Only their ends
You have respected: stopp'd your ears against
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private whisper, no, not with such friends
That thought them sure of you.

 I was moved withal.

 I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour
At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
Myself a former fortune.

The Ladies make signs to Coriolanus.
 Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
Deliver them this paper: having read it,
Bid them repair to the market-place; where I,
Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to appear before the people, hoping
To purge himself with words: dispatch.

Exeunt Attendants.
Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction.
Most welcome!

 Even so
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
And with his charity slain.

 Sir, I cannot tell:
We must proceed as we do find the people.

 I know it;
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction.   I raised him, and I pawn'd
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
He bow'd his nature, never known before
But to be rough, unswayable and free.

 That I would have spoke of;
Being banish'd for 't, he came unto my hearth;
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
My best and freshest men; served his designments
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
Which he did end all his; and took some pride
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
He waged me with his countenance, as if
I had been mercenary.

 There was it:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!

Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People.
 Say no more:
Here come the lords.
Enter the Lords of the city.
 I have not deserved it.
But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
What I have written to you?

 He approaches: you shall hear him.
Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; Commoners being with him.
 Read it not, noble lords;
But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
He hath abused your powers.

 Ay, traitor, Marcius!

 Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
Coriolanus in Corioli?
You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
He has betray'd your business, and given up,
For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
Look'd wondering each at other.

 Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

 No more.

 Why, noble lords,
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
'Fore your own eyes and ears?

 Insolent villain!

 My noble masters, hear me speak.

 My lords, when you shall know—as in this rage,
Provoked by him, you cannot—the great danger
Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
Myself your loyal servant, or endure
Your heaviest censure.

 My rage is gone;
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
Which to this hour bewail the injury,
Yet he shall have a noble memory.
Assist.

Exeunt, bearing the body of Coriolanus. A dead march sounded.
"
111,ant.,ANTONIO,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/mv.xml-ant.," In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn;
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
That I have much ado to know myself.

 Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year:
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

 Fie, fie!

 Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it, your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart.

 I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.

 Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.

 Is that any thing now?

 Well, tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
That you to-day promised to tell me of?

 I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
Within the eye of honor, be assured,
My purse, my person, my extremest means,
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.

 You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done,
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.

 Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
Try what my credit can in Venice do:
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
Where money is, and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake.
[Exeunt.
 Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would?

 And for three months.

 I do never use it.

 And what of him? did he take interest?

 This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

 Mark you this, Bassanio,
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

 Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

 I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.

 Content, i' faith; I'll seal to such a bond
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

 Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
Within these two months, that's a month before
This bond expires, I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

 Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

 Hie thee, gentle Jew.
[Exit Shylock.
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.

 Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
My ships come home a month before the day.
[Exeunt.
 Who's there?

 Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
Bassanio presently will go aboard:
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

 Hear me yet, good Shylock.

 I pray thee, hear me speak.

 Let him alone:
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me;
Therefore he hates me.

 The duke cannot deny the course of law:
For the commodity that strangers have
With us in Venice, if it be denied,
Will much impeach the justice of his state;
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
These griefs and losses have so bated me,
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
[Exeunt. Ready, so please your grace.

 I have heard
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
The very tyranny and rage of his.

 I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well do any thing most hard,
As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
Make no more offers, use no farther means,
But with all brief and plain conveniency
Let me have judgement and the Jew his will.

 I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me:
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk.
 Ay, so he says.

 I do.

 Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgement.

 But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honorable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.

 So please my lord the duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
I am content; so he will let me have
The other half in use, to render it,
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter:
Two things provided more, that, for this favor,
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift,
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.

 And stand indebted, over and above,
In love and service to you evermore.

 My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
Let his deservings and my love withal
Be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment.

 No more than I am well acquitted of.

 I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

 I once did lend my body for his wealth;
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.

 Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.

 I am dumb.

 Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road.

"
112,agam.,AGAMEMNON,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/tro.xml-agam.," Princes,
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
The ample proposition that hope makes
In all designs begun on earth below
Fails in the promised largeness: checks and disasters
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
As knots by the conflux of meeting sap,
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
Nor, princes, is it matter new to us           
That we come short of our suppose so far
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
Sith every action that hath gone before,
Whereof we have record, trial did draw
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
And that unbodied figure of the thought
That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
Do you with cheeks abashed behold our works,
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
But the protractive trials of great Jove      
To find persistive constancy in men:
The fineness of which metal is not found
In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
The wise and the fool, the artist and unread,
The hard and soft, seem all affined and kin:
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
And what hath mass or matter, by itself
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.          Speak, Prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect 
That matter needless, of importless burden,
Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
We shall hear music, wit and oracle. The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses, 
What is the remedy? What trumpet? look, Menelaus. What would you 'fore our tent? Even this. With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
Call Agamemnon head and general. How! This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
Are ceremonious courtiers. Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas? What's your affair, I pray you? He hears nought privately that comes from Troy. Speak frankly as the wind;
It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
That thou shalt know, Trojan, he is awake,
He tells thee so himself. This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;
If none of them have soul in such a kind,
We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
That means not, hath not, or is not in lovely
If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he. Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
Achilles shall have word of this intent;
So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
Yourself shall feast with us before you go
And find the welcome of a noble foe.           
[Exeunt all but Ulysses and Nestor. Where is Achilles? Let it be known to him that we are here.
He shent our messengers; and we lay by
Our appertainments, visiting of him:
Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
We dare not move the question of our place,
Or know not what we are. Hear you, Patroclus:
We are too well acquainted with these answers:
But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him, 
We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,
If you do say we think him over-proud
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
Than in the note of judgement; and worthier than himself
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
Disguise the holy strength of their command,
And underwrite in an observing kind
His humorous predominance; yea, watch
His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if 
The passage and whole carriage of this action
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
That if he overhold his price so much,
We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine
Not portable, lie under this report:
'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so. In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
[Exit Ulysses.      What's his excuse? Why will he not upon our fair request
Untent his person and share the air with us? Let Ajax go to him.
Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
At your request a little from himself. O, no, you shall not go.  Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
[Exeunt.  What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand. Let Diomedes bear him, 
And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready. We'll execute your purpose, and put on 
A form of strangeness as we pass along:
So do each lord, and either greet him not,
Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way. What says Achilles? would he aught with us? The better.            
[Exeunt Agamemnon and Nestor. Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
Anticipating time with starting courage.
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air
May pierce the head of the great combatant
And hale him thither. Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter? Is this the Lady Cressid? Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady. Yonder comes the troop.
Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS,
and other Trojans, with Attendants. Which way would Hector have it? Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
Consent upon the order of their fight,      
So be it; either to the uttermost,
Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
[Ajax and Hector enter the lists.  What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy? The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd;
His heart and hand both open and both free;
For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows; 
Yet gives he not till judgement guide his bounty,
Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath;
Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
To tender objects, but he in heat of action
Is more vindicative than jealous love:
They call him Troilus, and on him erect
A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
Even to his inches, and with private soul 
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.            
[Alarum.   Hector and Ajax fight. They are in action. His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax! Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
That would be rid of such an enemy;
But that's no welcome: understand more clear.
What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
And formless ruin of oblivion;
But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
Bids thee, with most divine integrity,       
From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome. [To Troilus] My well-famed lord of Troy, no less to you. First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
There in the full convive we: afterwards,
As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
Concur together, severally entreat him.
Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
That this great soldier may his welcome know.        
Exeunt all except Troilus and Ulysses.  We go wrong, we go wrong. So now, fair Prince of Troy, I bid good night.
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you. Good night.          
[Exeunt Agamemnon and Menelaus.  Renew, renew!   The fierce Polydamas
Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
Hath Doreus prisoner,
And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
Upon the pashed corses of the kings          
Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,
Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes
Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary
Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,
To reinforcement, or we perish all.
                 Enter NESTOR. Hark! hark! what shout is that? March patiently along: let one be sent
To pray Achilles to see us at our tent.
If in his death the gods have us befriended,
Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.               
[Exeunt, marching. 
"
113,fent.,FENTON,Globe_Shakespeare/wiv.xml,1,Globe_Shakespeare/wiv.xml-fent.,"     Yes, marry, have I; what of that?

   I see I cannot get thy father's love;
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

 Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object I am too great of birth;
And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
My riots past, my wild societies;
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.

 No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.

 Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

 Sir, will you hear me?

 Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all checks, rebukes and manners,
I must advance the colours of my love
And not retire: let me have your good will.

 Farewell, gentle mistress; farewell, Nan.
[Exeunt Mrs. Page and Anne. 
 I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.

 Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.

 From time to time I have acquainted you
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
Of such contents as you will wonder at;
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
That neither singly can be manifested,
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry: she hath consented:
Now, sir,
Her mother, ever strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white,
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
The better to denote her to the doctor,
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head:
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
The maid hath given consent to go with him.

 Both, my good host, to go along with me:
And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
And, in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.

 So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
Besides, I'll make a present recompense.
[Exeunt.
 You do amaze: hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully,
Where there was no proportion held in love.
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
The offence is holy that she hath committed;
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.
